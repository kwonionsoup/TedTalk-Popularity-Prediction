0,"And when I started my blog, it was really this one goal -- I said, ""I am not going to be famous to the world, but I could be famous to people on the Internet."" Because the joke in this is that this person is not a tyrant, this person is so loving and so sweet that he lets me dress him up and post pictures of him to my blog. And we started with a slide of my Teds, and I had to add this slide, because I knew the minute I showed this, my mom -- my mom will see this, because she does read my blog and she'll say, ""Why wasn't there a picture of me?"" So, I have all the people that I know of. And to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs; to think about the people that are on those $100 computers, talking about who they are, sharing these personal stories -- this is an amazing thing. So I do something that's very narcissistic -- I am a blogger -- that is an amazing thing for me, because it captures a moment in time every day. And the last story I really want to tell is this story, because this is probably the one that means the most to me in all of what I'm doing. But the big thing that really influenced us was, her sister wrote to me, and she said -- and she wrote on this blog -- that writing her blog during the last couple of months of her life was probably the best thing that had happened to her, and being able to talk to people and to share what was going on, and being able to write and receive comments. And that was amazing, to be able to know that we had empowered that, and that blogging was something that she felt comfortable doing, and the idea that blogging doesn't have to be scary, that we don't always have to be attack of the blogs, that we can be people who are open, and wanting to help and talk to people. So, this is her legacy, and I think that my call to action to all of you is: think about blogs, think about what they are, think about what you've thought of them, and then actually do it, because it's something that's really going to change our lives.","bob greene: when i started my blog, i said, ""i am not going to be famous to the world, but I could be famous to people on the Internet"" he says my blog captures a moment in time every day. greene: blogging is something that's really going to change our lives.","The founding mother of the blog revolution, Movable Type's Mena Trott, talks about the early days of blogging, when she realized that giving regular people the power to share our lives online is the key to building a friendlier, more connected world."
1,"And I told it pretty much the same way I've just shared it with you: Tipper and I were driving ourselves, Shoney's, low-cost family restaurant chain, what the man said -- they laughed. And I thought to myself, in the middle of the night, in the middle of the Atlantic, what in the world could be wrong in Washington? (Laughter) But what it turned out to be, was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech, and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America. (Applause) Al Gore: I want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on: What can you do about the climate crisis? Cars and trucks -- I talked about that in the slideshow, but I want you to put it in perspective. OK. Now, what can you do? Those of you who are good at branding, I'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people. A lot more to be said about that. And so I'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse, in communities all across the country, and we're going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week, to keep it right on the cutting edge. This used to be a bipartisan issue, and I know that in this group it really is.","john avlon: i'm going to give a course this summer on branding. avlon: i'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people. he says it used to be a bipartisan issue, and in this group it really is. avlon: i'm going to give it en masse, in communities all across the country.","With the same humor and humanity he exuded in ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" Al Gore spells out 15 ways that individuals can address climate change immediately, from buying a hybrid to inventing a new, hotter brand name for global warming."

What do you do here?"" I'm like, ""You're a what?"" So, I'm going to show you an example of a company that does not have a tap counter. (Laughter) This is Microsoft Word. You do not.

3,"And the idea there is that outside the spaceship, the universe is implacably hostile, and inside is all we have, all we depend on, and we only get the one chance: if we mess up our spaceship, we've got nowhere else to go. Well, is this a typical place? All you've got to do is go a few hundred miles in that same direction and look back, and you won't see any walls or chemical scum at all -- all you see is a blue planet. And if you go further than that, you'll see the Sun, the solar system and the stars and so on, but that's still not typical of the universe, because stars come in galaxies. It's so dark, that if you were to be looking at the nearest star to you, and that star were to explode as a supernova, and you were to be staring directly at it at the moment when its light reached you, you still wouldn't be able to see even a glimmer. (Laughter) And yet, from intergalactic space, it's so far away you wouldn't even see it. Now, how do we know about an environment that's so far away and so different and so alien from anything we're used to? Now, that is knowledge. Well, again, it's dark out there to human senses, but all you've got to do is take a telescope, even one of present-day design, look out, and you'll see the same galaxies as we do from here. And if we want to be the exception to that, then logically, our only hope is to make use of the one feature that distinguishes our species and civilization from all the others, namely, our special relationship with the laws of physics, our ability to create new explanations, new knowledge -- to be a hub of existence.","if we mess up our spaceship, we've got nowhere else to go. if we mess up our spaceship, we've got nowhere else to go. if we mess up our spaceship, we've got nowhere else to go. if we mess up our spaceship, we've got nowhere else to go.","Legendary scientist David Deutsch puts theoretical physics on the back burner to discuss a more urgent matter: the survival of our species.

4,"I can't help but this wish: to think about when you're a little kid, and all your friends ask you, ""If a genie could give you one wish in the world, what would it be?"" But in 2003, when the war in Iraq was about to start, it was a very surreal feeling for me, because before the war started, there was kind of this media war that was going on. I didn't even have a camera at the time -- I had somebody bring it there, because I wanted to get access to Al Jazeera, George Bush's favorite channel, and a place which I was very curious about because it's disliked by many governments across the Arab world, and also called the mouthpiece of Osama Bin Laden by some people in the US government. So, the impact that had on me -- me realizing that I just saw people on the other side, and those people in the Al Jazeera office must have felt the way I was feeling that night, and it upset me on a profound level that I wasn't as bothered as much the night before. You know, we're criticized abroad for believing we're the saviors of the world in some way, but the flip side of it is that, actually, when people do see what is happening abroad and people's reactions to some of our policy abroad, we feel this power, that we need to -- we feel like we have to get the power to change things. But I know the power of it, I know that it starts people thinking about how to change the world. And that's what this is about. There's Working Films and there's Current TV, which is an incredible platform for people around the world to be able to put their -- (Applause) Yeah, it's amazing. I know that it's very intangible, touching people's hearts and souls, but the only way that I know how to do it, the only way that I know how to reach out to somebody's heart and soul all across the world, is by showing them a film. But it would be the day that the world comes together through film, the power of film.","john avlon: if a genie could give you one wish in the world, what would it be? avlon: it would be the day that the world comes together through film, the power of film. he says working films and current television are an incredible platform for people. avlon: it would be the day that the world comes together through film.",Jehane Noujaim unveils her 2006 TED Prize wish: to bring the world together for one day a year through the power of film.
5,"And so I want to tell you about that first, and then go on into where I think love is going. You can list what you don't like about them, but then you sweep that aside and focus on what you do. It would be nice to go to bed with them, but you want them to call you on the telephone, to invite you out, etc., to tell you that they love you. And in fact, I think it's more powerful than the sex drive. I'll say just a couple of things, and then go on to sex and love. I don't know why they want to think that men and women are alike. And I say, ""Who do you think these men are sleeping with?"" People around the world, in a study of 37 societies, want to be in love with the person that they marry. Dopamine's associated with romantic love, and you can just fall in love with somebody who you're just having casual sex with.

6,"It began with a conversation with a woman. I think if you had told me when I was younger that I was going to grow up, and be in shoe stores, and people would scream out, ""There she is, the Vagina Lady!"" (Laughter) But I want to talk a little bit about happiness, and the relationship to this whole vagina journey, because it has been an extraordinary journey that began eight years ago. I think what I learned from talking about the vagina and speaking about the vagina, is it was the most obvious thing -- it was right in the center of my body and the center of the world -- and yet it was the one thing nobody talked about. What I have learned is two things: one, that the epidemic of violence towards women is shocking; it's global; it is so profound and it is so devastating, and it is so in every little pocket of every little crater, of every little society that we don't even recognize it, because it's become ordinary. What has also happened is in the course of these travels -- and it's been an extraordinary thing -- is that every single place that I have gone to in the world, I have met a new species. (Laughter) But one of the things I've seen is this species -- and it is a species, and it is a new paradigm, and it doesn't get reported in the press or in the media because I don't think good news ever is news, and I don't think people who are transforming the planet are what gets the ratings on TV shows. And it's been really interesting to be in my head for the last two days; I've been very disoriented -- (Laughter) because I think the world, the V-world, is very much in your body. And she came, and she witnessed this, and she decided that she would go back and leave her husband, and that she would bring V-Day to Guatemala. And he had shown up, obviously, in a form that it took me a long time to understand, which is that when we give in the world what we want the most, we heal the broken part inside each of us.","the epidemic of violence towards women is shocking; it's global, says nadine dos santos. dos santos: every single place that i've gone to in the world, I have met a new species. she says if we give in the world what we want most, we heal the broken part inside each of us. dos santos: if we give in the world what we want the most, we heal the broken part inside us","Eve Ensler, creator of ""The Vagina Monologues,"" shares how a discussion about menopause with her friends led to talking about all sorts of sexual acts onstage, waging a global campaign to end violence toward women and finding her own happiness."
7,"And that was: What is the purpose of this? And then when I wrote this book, and all of a sudden, it just took off, and I started saying, now, what's the purpose of this? I just don't believe that. And when you write a book that the first sentence of the book is, ""It's not about you,"" then, when all of a sudden it becomes the best-selling book in history, you've got to figure, well, I guess it's not about me. And I'm going, what do I do with this? And I gave it back because I didn't want anybody thinking that I do what I do for money -- I don't. And as I read that, I looked at it, and I thought, you know, what this is saying is that the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence. You know, there's a story in the Bible about Moses, whether you believe it's true or not, it really doesn't matter to me. I just, this is why I love what Michael does, because it's like, if he's debunking it, then I don't have to.

8,"It is in this spirit that I join into a discussion of one of the critical issues of our time, namely, how to mobilize different forms of capital for the project of state building. But we are not dealing with the implications of the one world that we are living in. And that is that if we want to have one world, this one world cannot be based on huge pockets of exclusion, and then inclusion for some. Now, the issue that should concern us here -- and that's the challenge that I would like to pose to this group -- is again, it takes 16 years in your countries to produce somebody with a B.S. And I hope that this group would be able to deal with the issue of state and development and the empowerment of the majority of the world's poor, through this means. But we have to understand that we've been incredibly lucky. You know, when I went back in December of 2001, I had absolutely no desire to work with the Afghan government because I'd lived as a nationalist. And what I will say here is that aid doesn't work.

9,"One is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we've had and in all of the people here; just the variety of it and the range of it. But if you are, and you say to somebody, you know, they say, ""What do you do?"" (Applause) That was it, by the way. We were sitting there, and I think they just went out of sequence, because we talked to the little boy afterward and said, ""You OK with that?"" I was. Isn't it? (Laughter) Don't they?

10,"On September 10, the morning of my seventh birthday, I came downstairs to the kitchen, where my mother was washing the dishes and my father was reading the paper or something, and I sort of presented myself to them in the doorway, and they said, ""Hey, happy birthday!"" And he said, ""So?"" And I said, ""So? (Laughter) Now, I didn't know it at the time, but I really wasn't turning seven on September 10th.

Now, I was raised in the Pacific Northwest, around a lot of Church of Latter-day Saints people and, you know, I've worked with them and even dated them, but I never really knew the doctrine, or what they said to people when they were out on a mission, and I guess I was sort of curious, so I said, ""Well, please, come in."" And they said, ""Well, then we have a story to tell you."" And I said, ""No, I don't,"" because I was sort of upset about this Lamanite story and this crazy gold plate story, but the truth was, I hadn't really thought this through, so I backpedaled a little and I said, ""Well, what exactly do you mean by 'righteous'?

So you're not just doing a building for the residents or for the people who are going to use it, but for the community as a whole. And I didn't know what I was doing -- like I said, mid-20s -- and I'm the Internet generation, so we started a website. (Laughter) So what you don't know is, we've got these thousands of designers working around the world, connected basically by a website, and we have a staff of three. The idea is it's not just a clinic, it's a community center. They said, this is our design, because it's not only about engaging a community; it's about empowering a community, and about getting them to be a part of the rebuilding process. And what that means is we actually live and work with the community, and they're part of the design process. Because you know what? So it's going to take a lot of computing power, because I want the idea that any laptop anywhere in the world can plug into the system and be able to not only participate in developing these designs, but utilize the designs. And so, you know, I want these -- I just should note: I have two laptops and one of them is there, and that has 3000 designs on it.","cnn's richard quest started a website that connects thousands of designers around the world. quest: it's not just a clinic, it's a community center. he says it's going to take a lot of computing power. quest: it's going to take a lot of computing power.","Accepting his 2006 TED Prize, Cameron Sinclair demonstrates how passionate designers and architects can respond to world housing crises.

12,"But the students are not there. (Laughter) This is where I realized that there was really a need to communicate, because the data of what's happening in the world and the child health of every country is very well aware. Can you see there? But in the middle, we have most of the world population, and they have now 24 percent of the income. And you have the OECD there, and you have sub-Saharan Africa there, and we take off the Arab states there, coming both from Africa and from Asia, and we put them separately, and we can expand this axis, and I can give it a new dimension here, by adding the social values there, child survival. And if we move back again, here, and we put trails on them, like this, you can see again that the speed of development is very, very different, and the countries are moving more or less at the same rate as money and health, but it seems you can move much faster if you are healthy first than if you are wealthy first. Now, this is, more or less, if you look at the average data of the countries -- they are like this. So if I go and look here, we can see that Uganda today is where South Korea was in 1960. But this is what we would like to see, isn't it? These countries are lifting more than the economy, and it will be very interesting to follow this over the year, as I would like you to be able to do with all the publicly funded data.","most of the world population has now 24 percent of the income. but the speed of development is very, very different. it seems you can move much faster if you are healthy first than if you are wealthy first.","You've never seen data presented like this.

13,"You don't do book talks at TED, but I'm going to have just one slide about my book, because there is one message in it which I think this group really needs to hear. They don't have to be. It doesn't have to be. And there was a passage in it which he did not present here and I think it is so good, I'm going to read it to you: ""Over billions of years on a unique sphere, chance has painted a thin covering of life: complex, improbable, wonderful and fragile. And what I want to do now is say a bit about this book from the design standpoint, because I think it's actually a brilliant book. This is the evolution of religion that's been going on for thousands of years, and he's just the latest brilliant practitioner of it. We don't need a belief in God to be good or to have meaning in us. I'm afraid that a lot of people take that sentiment to mean that we don't have to do the sorts of things that Al Gore is trying so hard to get us to do. And what I find deeply troubling in this book is that he seems to be arguing that if you want to be moral, if you want to have meaning in your life, you have to be an Intelligent Designer, you have to deny the theory of evolution by natural selection. I don't believe it and I think this idea, popular as it is -- not in this guise, but in general -- is itself one of the main problems that we face.","john avlon: al gore's book on evolution is a brilliant example of evolution. avlon: we don't need a belief in God to be good or to have meaning in us. avlon: if you want to be moral, if you want to have meaning in your life, you have to be an Intelligent Designer.","Philosopher Dan Dennett calls for religion -- all religion -- to be taught in schools, so we can understand its nature as a natural phenomenon.

(Laughter) We all know what's good about it, so I'm going to talk about what's bad about it. The second effect is that, even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice, we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from. One of them is, with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from, if you buy one and it's not perfect -- and what salad dressing is? All this choice made it possible for me to do better. There are lots of places in the world, and we have heard about several of them, where their problem is not that they have too much choice. Because the truth of the matter is, if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible, you don't have freedom.","bob greene: when you wake up in the morning, you have to decide what kind of person you want to be. greene: even if we overcome the paralysis and make a choice, we end up less satisfied. he says there are lots of places in the world where their problem is not that they have too much choice. greene: if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible, you don't have freedom.","Psychologist Barry Schwartz takes aim at a central tenet of western societies: freedom of choice.

By pulling a string, it vibrates and produces a sound wave, which passes through a piece of wood called a bridge, and goes down to the wood box and gets amplified, but ... let me think. (Laughter) OK, this is sort of technology, but I can call it a 16th-century technology. (Laughter) The violin is very beautiful.

You know, like that. What's really interesting here is what you can do with it and the kind of interfaces you can build on top of it.

And if you remember one thing from what I want to talk about today, it's that the only way to end poverty, to make it history, is to build viable systems on the ground that deliver critical and affordable goods and services to the poor, in ways that are financially sustainable and scaleable. And I want to talk a little bit about that, and some of the examples, so you can see what it is that we're doing. That's who we talk about when we think about ""the poor."" One is in India, where there are 240 million farmers, most of whom make less than two dollars a day. On the distribution side, though, as a world, we have a lot of work to do. And so, when I told her about our idea -- that maybe we could take a Tupperware model from the United States, and find a way for the women themselves to go out and sell these nets to others -- she quickly started calculating what she herself could make and signed up. She brought 10 of the women with whom she interacts together to see if she could sell these nets, five dollars apiece, despite the fact that people say nobody will buy one, and we learned a lot about how you sell things. And we've started making curtains, and not only is it beautiful, but people can see status -- that you care about your children. And so I urge all of you to think next time as to how to engage with this notion and this opportunity that we all have -- to make poverty history -- by really becoming part of the process and moving away from an us-and-them world, and realizing that it's about all of us, and the kind of world that we, together, want to live in and share.",john avlon: only way to end poverty is to build viable systems on the ground. avlon: 240 million farmers in india make less than two dollars a day. avlon: we need to build systems that deliver critical and affordable goods to the poor. avlon: we need to make poverty history by really becoming part of the process.,"Jacqueline Novogratz applauds the world's heightened interest in Africa and poverty, but argues persuasively for a new approach."

20,"And so we're going to have to do a lot of work that goes beyond just the Internet. And the reason for this is that most people understand the need for neutrality. So how do we do this? The reason for this is if we say we're only going to write the ""truth"" about some topic, that doesn't do us a damn bit of good of figuring out what to write, because I don't agree with you about what's the truth. So this neutrality policy is really important for us because it empowers a community that is very diverse to come together and actually get some work done. This is really important because a lot of new pages are just garbage that has to be deleted, you know, ""ASDFASDF."" Is it what? So as an example of how this can be important: we recently had a situation where a neo-Nazi website discovered Wikipedia, and they said, ""Oh, well, this is horrible, this Jewish conspiracy of a website, and we're going to get certain articles deleted that we don't like. And we see they have a voting process, so we're going to send -- we have 40,000 members and we're going to send them over and they're all going to vote and get these pages deleted.""

21,"I'm Rich Baraniuk and what I'd like to talk a little bit about today are some ideas that I think have just tremendous resonance with all the things that have been talked about the last two days. But I'm not here to talk about music today. So, that's what I'd like to talk about and, really, how we get from where we are now to where we need to go. Imagine making it free, so that anyone in the world can have access to all of this knowledge, and imagine using information technology so that you can update this content, improve it, play with it, on a timescale that's more on the order of seconds instead of years. Over the last six-and-a-half years, we've been working really hard at Rice University on a project called Connexions, and so what I'd like to do for the rest of the talk is just tell you a little bit about what people are doing with Connexions, which you can kind of think of as the counterpoint to Nicholas Negroponte's talk yesterday, where they're working on the hardware of bringing education to the world. And to them, this idea of being able to remix and customize to the local context is extraordinarily important, because just providing free content to people has actually been likened by people in the developing world to a kind of cultural imperialism -- that if you don't empower people with the ability to re-contextualize the material, translate it into their own language and take ownership of it, it's not good. And I think that really, in a sense, what we're trying to do is make Minsky's dream come to a reality, where you can imagine all the books in a library actually starting to talk to each other. So, what we have to do is get it right from the very beginning. In fact, you're free to share it, to do all of these things: to copy it, to change it, even to make commercial use of it, as long as you attribute the author. All of you here are tremendously imbued with tremendous amounts of knowledge, and what I'd like to do is invite each and every one of you to contribute to this project and other projects of its type, because I think together we can truly change the landscape of education and educational publishing.",rich baraniuk: connexions is a project that aims to bring education to the world. he says it's a counterpoint to n. negroponte's talk on cultural imperialism. baraniuk: we need to empower people to re-contextualize the material.,"In 2006, open-learning visionary Richard Baraniuk explains the vision behind Connexions (now called OpenStax), an open-source, online education system.

22,"And that's why we have to really talk about this a lot -- evangelize, I will go so far as to say, quite a lot -- in order to get people's attention, and make people realize that they are in a trance in this regard. So that's all I'm going to say about that. So we can put it this way: we can say that, you know, we have this chain of events. Because, you know, most people, when they hear that I predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to 1,000 or more, they think that I'm saying that we're going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are so thoroughly eliminating aging that those therapies will let us live to 1,000 or more. If you're already 100, or even if you're 80 -- and an average 80-year-old, we probably can't do a lot for you with these therapies, because you're too close to death's door for the really initial, experimental therapies to be good enough for you. So this is a genuine conclusion that I come to, that the first 150-year-old -- we don't know how old that person is today, because we don't know how long it's going to take to get these first-generation therapies. And this is what it is. So, these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago and that is pretty good news, because it means that, you know, we've come a long way in biology in these 20 years, so the fact that we haven't extended this list is a pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done. I haven't got time to go through them at all, but my conclusion is that, if we can actually get suitable funding for this, then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only 10 years, but we do need to get serious about it. And I think we know how to do it.","aaron carroll: gerontologists say we're going to invent therapies that eliminate aging. carroll: we don't know how old that person is today, but we don't know how long it will take. he says we can develop robust mouse rejuvenation in 10 years, but we need to get serious. carroll: if we can get funding for this, we can probably develop mouse rejuvenation in 10 years.","Cambridge researcher Aubrey de Grey argues that aging is merely a disease -- and a curable one at that.

This is the most important slide that I've ever seen in public health, [Sovereigns killed by smallpox] because it shows you to be the richest and the strongest, and to be kings and queens of the world, did not protect you from dying of smallpox. There are 20 million people on the road at any time, in buses and trains, walking; 500,000 villages, 120 million households, and none of them wanted to report if they had a case of smallpox in their house, because they thought that smallpox was the visitation of a deity, Shitala Mata, the cooling mother, and it was wrong to bring strangers into your house when the deity was in the house. When we didn't search, we had the illusion that there was no disease. Now, if we had an ""undo"" button, and we could go back and isolate it and grab it when it first started -- if we could find it early, and we had early detection and early response, and we could put each one of those viruses in jail -- that's the only way to deal with something like a pandemic. And that simulation that I showed you that you thought was bird flu -- that was SARS.

25,"What I'm going to tell you today is that, in fact, based on 10 years of research, a unique opportunity to go inside a gang -- to see the actual books, the financial records of the gang -- that the answer turns out not to be that being in the gang was a glamorous life. And then third, I want to tell you, in a very superficial way, about some of the things we found when we actually got to look at the financial records, the books, of the gang. To do that, you have to actually go back to a time before crack cocaine, in the early '80s, and look at it from the perspective of a gang leader. But the thing is, there was no money in it. I don't have time to talk about it today, but if you think about it, I would say that in the last 25 years, of every invention or innovation that's occurred in this country, the biggest one in terms of impact on the well-being of people who live in the inner city, was crack cocaine. And it turned out there was this audience that didn't know it wanted crack cocaine, but when it came, it really did. And for the people who were there running the gang, it was a great way, seemingly, to make a lot of money. So if I have to kind of summarize very quickly in the short time I have what the bottom line of what I take away from the gang is, it's that, if I had to draw a parallel between the gang and any other organization, it would be that the gang is just like McDonald's, in a lot of different respects -- the restaurant McDonald's. So in some sense, the foot soldiers are a lot like the people who are taking your order at McDonald's, and it's not just by chance that they're like them. Let me do one last thing I hadn't thought I'd have time to do, which is to talk about what we learned more generally about economics, from the study of the gang.","bob greene: 10 years of research shows that crack cocaine was a great way to make money. he says the gang is just like McDonald's, in a lot of different respects. greene: if you had to draw a parallel, it would be that the gang is just like the restaurant McDonald's.","""Freakonomics"" author Steven Levitt presents new data on the finances of drug dealing.

26,"But if you look, if you have that perspective, then you can see what happened in the last 60 years. And if you agree with that, then I think the best way to improve these countries is to recognize that economic development is of the people, by the people, for the people. The question was, how much did it cost to install a new telephone in Bangladesh? I mean, in America, people buy cars, and they put very little money down. They get a car, and they go to work. In the United States, we have -- everybody needs a banking service, but very few of us are trying to buy a bank. So we could do that for telephones. I mean, of course there might be other good reasons, but this was one of the reasons -- they had to be. What is it that they really do?

35,"So, if the body is sensing that you have damage to an organ and then it's initiating cancer, it's almost as if this is a repair response. If somehow we can cause these cells to differentiate -- to become bone tissue, lung tissue, liver tissue, whatever that cancer has been put there to do -- it would be a repair process. But it struck me that I'd never heard of cancer of the heart, or cancer of any skeletal muscle for that matter. And so at first I kind of thought, ""Well, maybe there's some obvious explanation why skeletal muscle doesn't get cancer -- at least not that I know of."" Some of my hypotheses are that when you first think about skeletal muscle, there's a lot of blood vessels going to skeletal muscle. And one article that really stood out to me when I was just reading about this, trying to figure out why cancer doesn't go to skeletal muscle, was that it had reported 16 percent of micro-metastases to skeletal muscle upon autopsy. So this suggests that maybe if there is an anti-angiogenic factor in skeletal muscle -- or perhaps even more, an angiogenic routing factor, so it can actually direct where the blood vessels grow -- this could be a potential future therapy for cancer. Now, one thing that kind of ties the resistance of skeletal muscle to cancer -- to the cancer as a repair response gone out of control in the body -- is that skeletal muscle has a factor in it called ""MyoD."" So, is it possible that the tumor cells are going to the skeletal muscle tissue, but once in contact inside the skeletal muscle tissue, MyoD acts upon these tumor cells and causes them to become skeletal muscle cells? Maybe tumor cells are being disguised as skeletal muscle cells, and this is why it seems as if it is so rare.","skeletal muscle has a factor called ""MyoD,"" which acts upon tumor cells. tumor cells are going to the skeletal muscle tissue, but MyoD causes them to become skeletal muscle cells. if tumor cells are going to the skeletal muscle tissue, MyoD causes them to become skeletal muscle cells.",Eva Vertes -- only 19 when she gave this talk -- discusses her journey toward studying medicine and her drive to understand the roots of cancer and Alzheimerâ€™s.

They're faster, so you've got exponential growth in the speed of transistors, so the cost of a cycle of one transistor has been coming down with a halving rate of 1.1 years. And it's not just computers. Once we understand its principles of operation, and the pace with which we are reverse-engineering biology is accelerating, we can actually design these things to be thousands of times more capable. There's actually one going into human trial, so this is feasible technology. This is at an early stage, but you can show with the exponential growth of the amount of information about the brain and the exponential improvement in the resolution of brain scanning, we will succeed in reverse-engineering the human brain by the 2020s. Wall Street noticed that this was a revolutionary technology, which it was, but then six months later, when it hadn't revolutionized all business models, they figured, well, that was wrong, and then we had this bust. We'll have completed the reverse-engineering of the human brain, 1,000 dollars of computing will be far more powerful than the human brain in terms of basic raw capacity.

39,"But I think the most important one is that London was this city of 2.5 million people, and it was the largest city on the face of the planet at that point. So what ended up happening, actually, is they ended up increasing the outbreaks of cholera because, as we now know, cholera is actually in the water. So this was the state of London in 1854, and in the middle of all this carnage and offensive conditions, and in the midst of all this scientific confusion about what was actually killing people, it was a very talented classic 19th century multi-disciplinarian named John Snow, who was a local doctor in Soho in London, who had been arguing for about four or five years that cholera was, in fact, a waterborne disease, and had basically convinced nobody of this. Snow lived near there, heard about the outbreak, and in this amazing act of courage went directly into the belly of the beast because he thought an outbreak that concentrated could actually potentially end up convincing people that, in fact, the real menace of cholera was in the water supply and not in the air. And he thought about representing that as a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods, people who hadn't, you know, percentages of people who hadn't, but eventually he hit upon the idea that what he needed was something that you could see. And so, with the help of this map, and with the help of more evangelizing that he did over the next few years and that Whitehead did, eventually, actually, the authorities slowly started to come around. It took much longer than sometimes we like to think in this story, but by 1866, when the next big cholera outbreak came to London, the authorities had been convinced -- in part because of this story, in part because of this map -- that in fact the water was the problem. When people were looking at 10 percent of their neighborhoods dying in the space of seven days, there was a widespread consensus that this couldn't go on, that people weren't meant to live in cities of 2.5 million people. But because of what Snow did, because of this map, because of the whole series of reforms that happened in the wake of this map, we now take for granted that cities have 10 million people, cities like this one are in fact sustainable things. We don't worry that New York City is going to collapse in on itself quite the way that, you know, Rome did, and be 10 percent of its size in 100 years or 200 years.","cholera outbreaks in london increased because cholera is actually in the water. cholera is a waterborne disease, but it's not in the air, says dr. sanjay gupta. gupta: we don't have to worry about cholera outbreaks in cities of 2.5 million people.","Author Steven Johnson takes us on a 10-minute tour of The Ghost Map, his book about a cholera outbreak in 1854 London and the impact it had on science, cities and modern society."

When the terrorist incidents occurred in the United Kingdom a couple of years ago, I think even though they didn't claim as many lives as we lost in the United States on 9/11, I think the thing that troubled the British most was that the perpetrators were not invaders, but homegrown citizens whose religious and political identities were more important to them than the people they grew up with, went to school with, worked with, shared weekends with, shared meals with. When I organized my foundation, and I thought about the world as it is and the world that I hope to leave to the next generation, and I tried to be realistic about what I had cared about all my life that I could still have an impact on. (Applause) When I got out of office and was asked to work, first in the Caribbean, to try to help deal with the AIDS crisis, generic drugs were available for about 500 dollars a person a year. Now we can get it for about 100 dollars. So what we have been trying to do, working first in Rwanda and then in Malawi and other places -- but I want to talk about Rwanda tonight -- is to develop a model for rural health care in a very poor area that can be used to deal with AIDS, TB, malaria, other infectious diseases, maternal and child health, and a whole range of health issues poor people are grappling with in the developing world, that can first be scaled for the whole nation of Rwanda, and then will be a model that could literally be implemented in any other poor country in the world. The person, in my view, who has done the best job of this in the health care area, of building a system in a very poor area, is Dr. Paul Farmer, who, many of you know, has worked for now 20 years with his group, Partners in Health, primarily in Haiti where he started, but they've also worked in Russia, in Peru and other places around the world. Because it seemed to me if we could prove there was a model in Haiti and a model in Rwanda that we could then take all over the country, number one, it would be a wonderful thing for a country that has suffered as much as any on Earth in the last 15 years, and number two, we would have something that could then be adapted to any other poor country anywhere in the world.

42,"The second school I was at had big trees too, had a fantastic tulip tree, I think it was the biggest in the country, and it also had a lot of wonderful bushes and vegetation around it, around the playing fields. And 30 years later I was sitting in an airplane, next to a lady called Veronica, who came from Chile, and we were on a human rights tour, and she was starting to tell me what it was like to be tortured, and, from my very privileged position, this was the only reference point that I had. And it was an amazing learning experience because, for me, human rights have been something in which I had, you know, a part-time interest, but, mainly, it was something that happened to other people over there. But I got a phone call from Bono in 1985 and, as you know, he's a great singer, but he's a magnificent hustler, and -- (Laughter) -- a very hard guy to say no to, and he was saying, you know, just after I'd done the Biko song, we're going to do a tour for Amnesty, you have to be on it, and really that was the first time that I'd been out and started meeting people who'd watched their family being shot in front of them, who'd had a partner thrown out of an airplane into an ocean, and suddenly this world of human rights arrived in my world, and I couldn't really walk away in quite the same way as before. And Reebok set up a foundation after these Human Rights Now tours and there was a decision then -- well, we made a proposal, for a couple of years, about trying to set up a division that was going to give cameras to human rights activists. (Music) Woman: Life in the camp is never simple. Anyway, WITNESS has been trying to arm the brave people who often put their lives at risk around the world, with cameras, and I'd like to show you just a little more of that. And we've also been trying to get computers out to the world, so that groups can communicate much more effectively, campaign much more effectively, but now we have the wonderful possibility, which is given to us from the mobile phone with the camera in it, because that is cheap; it's ubiquitous; and it's moving fast all around the world -- and it's very exciting for us. And so, the dream is that we could have a world in which anyone who has anything bad happen to them of this sort has a chance of getting their story uploaded, being seen, being watched, that they really know that they can be heard, that there would be a giant website, maybe, a little like Google Earth, and you could fly over and find out the realities of what's going, for the world's inhabitants. In a way what this technology is allowing is, really, that a lot of the problems of the world can have a human face, that we can actually see who's dying of AIDS or who's being beaten up, for the first time, and we can hear their stories in a way that the blogger culture -- if we can move that into these sort of fields, I think we can really transform the world in all sorts of ways.",cnn's nina dos santos was on a human rights tour 30 years ago. she met people who'd watched their family being shot in front of them. now she's trying to arm the brave people who often put their lives at risk.,Musician and activist Peter Gabriel shares his very personal motivation for standing up for human rights with the watchdog group WITNESS -- and tells stories of citizen journalists in action.

And then with four screws, we put in a frame, then we snap in the device and we run with wires -- the one shown in green will go to the surface of the brain with electrodes, to the epileptic focus, the origin of the epilepsy, where we can sense the electrical signal and have computer analysis that tells us when to hit it with some electrical current to prevent the clinical manifestation of the seizure.","30 million americans have migraine headaches, and we need a means to treat it.

And maybe it's something that people in Oxford don't do very often, but if you ever make it to the sea, and you swallow a mouthful of seawater, keep in mind that each milliliter has about a million bacteria and on the order of 10 million viruses. We just take seawater and we filter it, and we collect different size organisms on different filters, and then take their DNA back to our lab in Rockville, where we can sequence a hundred million letters of the genetic code every 24 hours. Just to try and get an assessment of what our gene repertoire was, we assembled all the data -- including all of ours thus far from the expedition, which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet -- and it totaled around 29 million genes. Of those roughly 29 million genes, we only have around 24,000 in our genome. So we made a map of all the genes that could take transposon insertions and we called those ""non-essential genes."" But it turns out the environment is very critical for this, and you can only define an essential or non-essential gene based on exactly what's in the environment. The only way to prove these ideas was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them, and we had to do this in a cassette-based fashion.

So this is the list, and this is the one I'd like to share with you. And just to give you a sense of reference, the U.N. actually estimate that for half that amount, for about 75 billion dollars a year, we could solve all major basic problems in the world. It's not to say that if we had all the money in the world, we wouldn't want to do it. Again, what this does and what it focuses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV/AIDS. To start thinking about saying, ""Let's do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost, not the things that we don't know how to do, but let's do the great things where we can do an enormous amount of good, at very low cost, right now."" At the end of the day, you can disagree with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these, but we have to be honest and frank about saying, if there's some things we do, there are other things we don't do.","john avlon: if we don't do all things, we have to ask ourselves, which ones should we solve first? avlon: if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first, you can't ask either of them. avlon: we have to be honest and frank about saying, if there's some things we do, there are other things we don't do.","Given $50 billion to spend, which would you solve first, AIDS or global warming?

53,"If we were to wipe out insects alone, just that group alone, on this planet -- which we are trying hard to do -- the rest of life and humanity with it would mostly disappear from the land. By my college years, I was a devoted myrmecologist, a specialist on the biology of ants, but my attention and research continued to make journeys across the great variety of life on Earth in general -- including all that it means to us as a species, how little we understand it and how pressing a danger that our activities have created for it. About 16,000 species of nematode worms have been discovered and diagnosed by scientists; there could be hundreds of thousands of them, even millions, still unknown. They've had billions of years to do it, but especially during the earliest period of biological evolution on this planet. For example, even in the United States, the 200,000 species known currently actually has been found to be only partial in coverage; it is mostly unknown to us in basic biology. We urgently need to change this. We need to have the biosphere properly explored so that we can understand and competently manage it. What is the ""Encyclopedia of Life?"" And most of all, it can inspire a new generation of biologists to continue the quest that started, for me personally, 60 years ago: to search for life, to understand it and finally, above all, to preserve it. That is my wish.","about 16,000 species of nematode worms have been discovered and diagnosed by scientists. about 200,000 species known currently has been found to be only partial in coverage.

My mum was there; my brother was there; my granddad was there -- had a little Union Jack -- (Laughter) -- and that was about it. This time, I wanted to go right across, on my own this time, from Russia, at the top of the map, to the North Pole, where the sort of kink in the middle is, and then on to Canada. I think the joke is that Khatanga isn't the end of the world, but you can see it from there. I got up in the morning, took the tent down, skied north for seven-and-a-half hours, put the tent up, and I was two and a half miles further back than when I'd started.

But since this was called ""risk taking,"" I'm doing somebody who I never do, because she's so unlikeable that one person actually came backstage and told me to take her out of the show she was in. I didn't even want to accept the fact that she was dead, so I went in and I put a mirror to her mouth -- there was no thing, nothing, coming out of her mouth. So we went to the mall and we told a police that we had, like, lost her, that she was missing. And I told you that in -- you know, I didn't give you the year, but in '79 I thought that I was going to go around and find bull riders and pig farmers and people like that, and I got sidetracked on race relations.

56,"Now, this sounds like an intrinsically upbeat worldview in a way, because when you think of non-zero, you think win-win, you know, that's good. I kind of think this is a kind of a business-class morality. And by that I mean, if people in the Muslim world get more hateful, more resentful, less happy with their place in the world, it'll be bad for the West. That's what's responsible for this growth of this moral progress so far, and I'm saying we once again have a correlation of fortunes, and if people respond to it intelligently, we will see the development of tolerance and so on -- the norms that we need, you know. So, these two things, you know, if they get people's attention and drive home the positive correlation and people do what's in their self-interests, which is further the moral evolution, then they could actually have a constructive effect. It's especially hard to do when people hate you, OK, because you don't really, in a sense, want to completely understand why people hate you. (Laughter) You don't want to say, ""Well, yeah, I can kind of understand how a human being in those circumstances would hate the country I live in."" That's not a pleasant thing, but I think it's something that we're going to have to get used to and work on. Now, I want to stress that to understand, you know -- there are people who don't like this whole business of understanding the grassroots, the root causes of things; they don't want to know why people hate us. Now, social organization has reached the global level, and I guess, if there's good news I can say I'm bringing you, it's just that all the salvation of the world requires is the intelligent pursuit of self-interests in a disciplined and careful way.","if people get more hateful, more resentful, less happy with their place in the world, it'll be bad for the west. if people respond to it intelligently, we will see the development of tolerance and so on. if people do what's in their self-interests, then they could have a constructive effect.","Author Robert Wright explains ""non-zero-sumness"" -- the network of linked fortunes and cooperation that has guided our evolution to this point -- and how we can use it to help save humanity today."
57,"Brilliant later today -- I want to talk about the other pandemic, which is cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension -- all of which are completely preventable for at least 95 percent of people just by changing diet and lifestyle. We showed a few months ago -- we published the first study showing you can actually stop or reverse the progression of prostate cancer by making changes in diet and lifestyle, and 70 percent regression in the tumor growth, or inhibition of the tumor growth, compared to only nine percent in the control group. Now there is an epidemic of obesity: two-thirds of adults and 15 percent of kids. What's really concerning to me is that diabetes has increased 70 percent in the past 10 years, and this may be the first generation in which our kids live a shorter life span than we do. That's pitiful, and it's preventable. Now these are not election returns, these are the people -- the number of the people who are obese by state, beginning in '85, '86, '87 -- these are from the CDC website -- '88, '89, '90, '91 -- you get a new category -- '92, '93, '94, '95, '96, '97, '98, '99, 2000, 2001 -- it gets worse. But the people in Asia are starting to eat like we are, which is why they're starting to get sick like we are. They can make it fun and sexy and hip and crunchy and convenient to eat healthier foods, like -- I chair the advisory boards to McDonald's, and PepsiCo, and ConAgra, and Safeway, and soon Del Monte, and they're finding that it's good business. The salads that you see at McDonald's came from the work -- they're going to have an Asian salad. And so if we can do that, then we can free up resources for buying drugs that you really do need for treating AIDS and HIV and malaria and for preventing avian flu.","cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension are preventable for 95 percent of people. we can stop or reverse the progression of prostate cancer by changing diet and lifestyle. two-thirds of adults and 15 percent of kids are obese.",Forget the latest disease in the news: Cardiovascular disease kills more people than everything else combined -- and itâ€™s mostly preventable.

59,"And when I met her, she had just taken a walk over the Himalayas from Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, into Nepal, across to India -- 30 days -- to meet her leader, the Dalai Lama. And it really impressed me -- I met him two weeks after he got out of prison -- that he went through that experience, and ended up with the demeanor that he had. And this is -- well, at the time -- I did this 10 years ago -- that was 36 years after the Dalai Lama had left. As a teenager, he faced the invasion of his country, and had to deal with it -- he was the leader of the country. And we spent -- I was with a team -- two weeks with these guys out in the jungle watching them hunt. And I was -- I usually travel alone when I do my work, but I did this -- I hosted a program for Discovery, and when I went down with the team, I was quite concerned about going in with a whole bunch of people, especially into the Huaorani, deep into the Huaorani tribe. So, one thing we did five years ago: we started a program that links kids in indigenous communities with kids in the United States. And the way we do it is, we do it in workshops, and we bring people who want to learn digital workflow and storytelling, and have them work with the kids. This is all their movies.

61,"But what I think it was telling me is that we are this transient thing that's happening, and that the nature that you see out there -- the untouched shorelines, the untouched forest that I was able to see -- really bring in a sense of that geological time, that this has gone on for a long time, and we're experiencing it in a different way. There's something that we're not seeing there. It was the largest one. And I decided to start looking at something that, to me, had -- if the earlier work of looking at the landscape had a sense of lament to what we were doing to nature, in the recycling work that you're seeing here was starting to point to a direction. And again, I started to think that -- there was another epiphany -- that the whole world I was living in was a result of having plentiful oil. What it is, it's a landscape that is an intentional one. That condition's going to be there for the next 10 to 15 years if they realize what they want, which is, you know, 400 to 500 million more people coming into the cities.

62,"What I'd like to start off with is an observation, which is that if I've learned anything over the last year, it's that the supreme irony of publishing a book about slowness is that you have to go around promoting it really fast. Because everyone these days wants to know how to slow down, but they want to know how to slow down really quickly. No, we speed them up, don't we? And even things that are by their very nature slow -- we try and speed them up too. And if you go beyond sort of the country level, down at the micro-company level, more and more companies now are realizing that they need to allow their staff either to work fewer hours or just to unplug -- to take a lunch break, or to go sit in a quiet room, to switch off their Blackberrys and laptops -- you at the back -- mobile phones, during the work day or on the weekend, so that they have time to recharge and for the brain to slide into that kind of creative mode of thought. But thankfully, there is a backlash there in parenting as well, and you're finding that, you know, towns in the United States are now banding together and banning extracurriculars on a particular day of the month, so that people can, you know, decompress and have some family time, and slow down. But the new idea, the sort of revolutionary idea, of the Slow Movement, is that there is such a thing as ""good slow,"" too. Because people at the top of the chain, people like you, I think, are starting to realize that there's too much speed in the system, there's too much busyness, and it's time to find, or get back to that lost art of shifting gears. Because I think they're looking at the West, and they're saying, ""Well, we like that aspect of what you've got, but we're not so sure about that."" So all of that said, is it, I guess, is it possible?","people want to know how to slow down, but they want to know how to slow down really quickly. there is a backlash there in parenting as well, and there is such a thing as ""good slow,"" too. john sutter: it's time to find, or get back to that lost art of shifting gears.","Journalist Carl HonorÃ© believes the Western world's emphasis on speed erodes health, productivity and quality of life.

That the success of sliced bread, like the success of almost everything we've talked about at this conference, is not always about what the patent is like, or what the factory is like -- it's about can you get your idea to spread, or not. And I think that the way you're going to get what you want, or cause the change that you want to change, to happen, is to figure out a way to get your ideas to spread. But in a world where the TV-industrial complex is broken, I don't think that's a strategy we want to use any more.

And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy and they say, ""I thought you knew something about plants. Wherever you look around the world, you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away; these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to: whether it's the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the Penan -- a nomadic people from Southeast Asia, from Sarawak -- a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago, and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers, where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of Borneo away to the South China Sea, where the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest -- or, in the case of the Yanomami, it's the disease entities that have come in, in the wake of the discovery of gold.

Well, it turns out biology has this other very interesting meme, that you can take a linear string, which is a convenient thing to copy, and you can fold that into an arbitrarily complex 3D structure. Now, hopefully, those of you who know anything about graph theory can look at that, and that will satisfy you that that can also do arbitrary 3D structure, and in fact, you know, I can now take a dog, carve it up and then reassemble it so it's a linear string that will fold from a sequence. So, this sort of thinking about structure as computation and structure as information leads to other things, like this. So, I'm thinking about, how can we generalize the way we make all sorts of things, so you end up with this sort of guy, right? And I think we have to sort of redefine and rethink how we define structure and materials and assembly things, so that we can really share the information on how you do those things in a more profound way and build on each other's source code for structure. Maybe I'm getting a little too abstract, but you know, this is the sort of -- returning to our comic characters -- this is sort of the universe, or a different universe view, that I think is going to be very prevalent in the future -- from biotech to materials assembly. I've probably got a couple of minutes of questions, or I can show -- I think they also said that I do extreme stuff in the introduction, so I may have to explain that. But, you know, this is another way to look at the -- if you abstract again, this is a structure that is defined by the physics of the universe.","cnn's john sutter will give a talk on how we're going to make things in the future. sutter: we have to redefine and rethink how we define structure and materials. he says this is sort of the universe, or a different universe view, that's going to be prevalent. sutter: we have to share the information on how we make all sorts of things.","Inventor and MacArthur fellow Saul Griffith shares some innovative ideas from his lab -- from ""smart rope"" to a house-sized kite for towing large loads."
68,"It was a very old ritual that seemed symbolic of the political struggle that was changing the face of South Africa. This man was in an NGO feeding center, being helped as much as he could be helped. After the fall of Ceausescu, I went to Romania and discovered a kind of gulag of children, where thousands of orphans were being kept in medieval conditions. I spent a good deal of time with a man who lived with his family on a railway embankment and had lost an arm and a leg in a train accident. It was a story that wasn't trying to sell anything. So many children have been orphaned by the epidemic that grandmothers have taken the place of parents, and a lot of children had been born with HIV. This is an MSF hospital in Cambodia. At the time I was photographing in these different places, I thought I was covering separate stories, but on 9/11 history crystallized, and I understood I'd actually been covering a single story for more than 20 years, and the attack on New York was its latest manifestation. It was obvious that the Shi'ites were a force to be reckoned with, and we would do well to understand them and learn how to deal with them. And they went surfing.","a man who lost an arm and a leg in a train accident was in a gulag of children in Romania. on 9/11 history crystallized, and the attack on new york was its latest manifestation. the attack on new york was obvious that the Shi'ites were a force to be reckoned with.","Accepting his 2007 TED Prize, war photographer James Nachtwey shows his life's work and asks TED to help him continue telling the story with innovative, exciting uses of news photography in the digital era."
69,"We don't have that. A lot of times, when I do a talk like this, I talk about things that everybody in this room I'm sure has already heard of, but most people haven't. One of the biggest levers that we have in the developed world for changing the impact that we have on the planet is changing the way that we live in cities. But unfortunately, most of the people on the planet don't live in the cites we live in. And this is one of the things that we are looking for everywhere. And, you know, you get amazing things. You know? You get new tools for people in the developing world. You know? You know?","most of the people on the planet don't live in the cites we live in. but unfortunately, most of the people don't live in the cites we live in.","Worldchanging.com founder Alex Steffen argues that reducing humanityâ€™s ecological footprint is incredibly vital now, as the western consumer lifestyle spreads to developing countries."
70,"What I'm going to do, in the spirit of collaborative creativity, is simply repeat many of the points that the three people before me have already made, but do them -- this is called ""creative collaboration;"" it's actually called ""borrowing"" -- but do it through a particular perspective, and that is to ask about the role of users and consumers in this emerging world of collaborative creativity that Jimmy and others have talked about. It's when the Internet combines with these kinds of passionate pro-am consumers -- who are knowledgeable; they've got the incentive to innovate; they've got the tools; they want to -- that you get this kind of explosion of creative collaboration. So this is a huge challenge to the way we think creativity comes about. Do you go into your board and say, ""Look, I've got a fantastic idea for an embryonic product in a marginal market, with consumers we've never dealt with before, and I'm not sure it's going to have a big payoff, but it could be really, really big in the future?"" This is the phrase that I've used in some stuff which I've done with a think tank in London called Demos, where we've been looking at these people who are amateurs -- i.e., they do it for the love of it -- but they want to do it to very high standards. This is open; this is closed. Well, the first thing you can say, I think with certainty, is what Yochai has said already -- is there is a great big struggle between those two organizational forms. And so the debates about copyright, digital rights, so on and so forth -- these are all about trying to stifle, in my view, these kinds of organizations. So here is one of the challenges, I think, for people like me, who do a lot of work with government. If you're a games company, and you've got a million players in your game, you only need one percent of them to be co-developers, contributing ideas, and you've got a development workforce of 10,000 people.","""creative collaboration"" is actually called ""borrowing,"" but do it through a particular perspective. when the Internet combines with passionate pro-am consumers, you get this explosion of creative collaboration. the debates about copyright, digital rights, so on and so forth are all about trying to stifle organizations.","In this deceptively casual talk, Charles Leadbeater weaves a tight argument  that innovation isn't just for professionals anymore.

71,"This is actually quite meaningful to me, because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole -- we don't do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it -- and cars are thought so much as a product that it's a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side under the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art. And so cars, as art, brings it into an emotional plane -- if you accept that -- that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital A. And they put that same kind of tension into the sculpting of a car that you do in a great sculpture that you would go and look at in a museum. Why it means you have to wash a car, what is it, that sensuality you have to touch about it? And first of all, you have to go with me for a second, and say, you know, you could take the word ""love"" out of a lot of things in our society, put the word ""design"" in, and it still works, like this quote here, you know. I think this one here, there's a pop song that really describes Philippe Starck for me, you know, this is like you know, this is like puppy love, you know, this is cool right? And this idea that there is more to love, more to design, when it gets down to your neighbor, your other, it can be physical like this, and maybe in the future it will be. So, what we did was: instead of having a staff of artists that are just your wrist, we decided to free up a team of creative designers and engineers to find out what's the successor to the SUV phenomenon in America. And if you can imagine what this is like, to have these months of postcard indication of how great this team is working, and they're out there spending all this money, and they're learning, and they're doing all this stuff. And I think we felt much closer that day, we cut a lot of strings that didn't need to be there, and we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about.","cnn's john sutter talks with a team of car designers and engineers about the future of the SUV. sutter: ""we decided to free up a team of creative designers and engineers to find out what's the successor to the SUV phenomenon in America"" ""we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about,"" he says.","American designer Chris Bangle explains his philosophy that car design is an art form in its own right, with an entertaining -- and ultimately moving -- account of the BMW Group's Deep Blue project, intended to create the SUV of the future."
72,"Because I have to say, for my whole career, if there's anything that's been consistent, it's been that you can't do it. And I've had for 30 years an interest in a series of complexities where a series of forces are brought to bear, and to understand the nature of the final result of that, representing the building itself. And I'd been extremely interested in this notion of randomness as it produces architectural work and as it definitely connects to the notion of the city, an accretional notion of the city, and that led to various ideas of organization. It became kind of an idea for the notion of the surface of a work, and it was used in a project where we could unravel that surface, and it was a figurative idea that was going to be folded and made into a very, kind of complex space. And the idea was the relationship of the space, which was made up of the fold of the image, and the dialectic or the conflict between the figuration, and the clarity of the image and the complexity of the space, which were in dialog. It has a material identity and it's translucent and it's porous, and it allows us for a very different notion of what a skin of a building is. And what we really want to do -- well, the architects, if there are architects out there, this is the Laugier Hut; this is the primitive hut that's been around for so long -- and what we wanted to do is really build this, because they see themselves as the caretakers of the world, and we wanted them to look down at their satellite, how they see their own site, that eight-acre site, and we wanted nothing left. And a project that was realized in Austria, the Hooper Bank, which again used this idea of connecting typology, the traditional buildings, and morphology, or the relationship of the development of land as an idea, into a complex, which is a piece of a city where we can see part of it is literally just this augmenting, this movement of the land that's a very simple idea of just lifting it up and occupying it, and other parts are much more energetic and intense. And talk about that intensity in terms of the collisions of the kind of events they make that have to do with putting a series of systems together, and then where part of it is in the ground, part of it is oppositional lifts. And I'm a character that's extremely interested in understanding the nature of that constructed reality because there's no such thing as nature any more.","a series of forces are brought to bear, and to understand the nature of the final result. a figurative idea that was going to be folded and made into a very, kind of complex space. a project that was realized in Austria, the Hooper Bank, is a piece of a city.","Architect Thom Mayne has never been one to take the easy option, and this whistle-stop tour of the buildings he's created makes you glad for it. These are big ideas cast in material form."
73,"Now, why do I say that this is a big problem? Well, let's first look at the probability -- and this is very, very difficult to estimate -- but there have been only four studies on this in recent years, which is surprising. You would think that it would be of some interest to try to find out more about this given that the stakes are so big, but it's a very neglected area. And if we think about this, I think it's very clear that there are ways in which we could change things, not just by eliminating negatives, but adding positives. As far as I can see, all of you are users of this enhancement technology in this room, so that's a great thing. It's just better to be able to understand more of the world around you and the people that you are communicating with, and to remember what you have learned. It's also interesting to think about what other things are -- so if these all enabled great values, why should we think that evolution has happened to provide us with all the modalities we would need to engage with other values that there might be? And they would just stare at us with bafflement when we spend time listening to a beautiful performance, like the one we just heard -- because of people making stupid movements, and they would be really irritated and wouldn't see what we were up to. If you could actually choose to preserve your romantic attachments to one person, undiminished through time, so that wouldn't have to -- love would never have to fade if you didn't want it to. And then you can imagine some enhancements of human capacities.","there have been only four studies on this topic in recent years. aaron carroll: we could change things, not just by eliminating negatives, but adding positives. he says evolution has provided us with all the modalities we would need to engage with other values. carroll: if you could choose to preserve your romantic attachments to one person, undiminished through time.",Oxford philosopher and transhumanist Nick Bostrom examines the future of humankind and asks whether we might alter the fundamental nature of humanity to solve our most intrinsic problems.
74,"And I think, a lot of times, what we do is just, sort of, hold the mirror up to our clients, and sort of go, ""Duh! And the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day, all you do is look at the roof, and it's a really shitty experience. And another idea, again, that came from one of the nurses -- which I love -- was they took traditional, sort of, corporate white boards, then they put them on one wall of the patient's room, and they put this sticker there. So this is not particularly a new idea, kind of, seeing opportunities in things that are around you and snapping and turning them into a solution. This idea of the way that people cobble together solutions in our life -- and the things we kind of do in our environment that are somewhat subconscious but have huge potential -- is something that we look at a lot. So what is this? And putting yourself in the position of the person, and I think that's one of the threads that I've heard again from this conference is how do we put ourselves in other peoples' shoes and really feel what they feel? And I think that's what this is very much about. What do we do to start? So that's it.","a lot of times, what we do is just, sort of, hold the mirror up to our clients. a lot of times, what we do is just look at the roof, and it's a really shitty experience. putting ourselves in the position of the person is what this conference is about.","Showing a series of inspiring, unusual and playful products, British branding and design guru Paul Bennett explains that design doesn't have to be about grand gestures, but can solve small, universal and overlooked problems."
75,"And this is what this adventure's really about. (Laughter) It turns out that what this stuff is -- and Richard Dawkins has written about this -- is, this is really a river out of Eden. So, it's about the size of a little period on a sentence. Because each of us contains our entire gene code of where we've been for the past billion years, because we've evolved from that stuff, you can take that tree of life and collapse it back, and in the measure that you learn to reprogram, maybe we'll give birth to something that is very close to the first primordial ooze. And what you can do now is, you can outlay exactly what your chromosome is, and what the gene code on that chromosome is right here, and what those genes code for, and what animals they code against, and then you can tie it to the literature. They look at the same world and they say... (Laughter) That's how the same gene code -- that's why you have 30,000 genes, mice have 30,000 genes, husbands have 30,000 genes. You can make very small changes in gene code and get really different outcomes, even with the same string of letters. So, this is what a new map of the world looks like. And that's it.

82,"(Laughter) I'm also a software engineer, and I make lots of different kinds of art with the computer. And I think the main thing that I'm interested in is trying to find a way of making the computer into a personal mode of expression. And many of you out there are the heads of Macromedia and Microsoft, and in a way those are my bane: I think there's a great homogenizing force that software imposes on people and limits the way they think about what's possible on the computer. Of course, it's also a great liberating force that makes possible, you know, publishing and so forth, and standards, and so on. But, in a way, the computer makes possible much more than what most people think, and my art has just been about trying to find a personal way of using the computer, and so I end up writing software to do that. Chris has asked me to do a short performance, and so I'm going to take just this time -- maybe 10 minutes -- to do that, and hopefully at the end have just a moment to show you a couple of my other projects in video form. And the idea is to visualize their speech and song behind them with a large screen.

83,"However, that's just the initial idea I may have that we all get when we actually look and we try to interpret. Much more -- (Drum sound) and I just feel, at last, one with the stick and one with the drum. And so what we would do is that I would put my hands on the wall of the music room, and together, we would ""listen"" to the sounds of the instruments, and really try to connect with those sounds far, far more broadly than simply depending on the ear. And so therefore, I said to them, ""Well, look, if you refuse -- if you refuse me through those reasons, as opposed to the ability to perform and to understand and love the art of creating sound -- then we have to think very, very hard about the people you do actually accept."" And of course, being the participator of the sound, and that is, starting from the idea of what type of sound I want to produce, for example, this sound: (No sound) Can you hear anything? So all of my performances are based on entirely what I experience, and not by learning a piece of music, putting on someone else's interpretation of it, buying all the CDs possible of that particular piece of music, and so on and so forth, because that isn't giving me enough of something that is so raw and so basic, and something that I can fully experience the journey of. So, because of this explosion in access to sound, especially through the Deaf community, this has not only affected how music institutions, how schools for the deaf treat sound, and not just as a means of therapy -- although, of course, being a participator of music, that definitely is the case as well -- but it's meant that acousticians have had to really think about the types of halls they put together. I cannot give you any detail as far as what is actually happening with those halls, but it's just the fact that they are going to a group of people for whom so many years, we've been saying, ""Well, how on earth can they experience music? No, I don't like that piece,"" and so on. It may be that the chemistry isn't quite right between myself and that particular piece of music, but that doesn't mean I have the right to say it's a bad piece of music.","acousticians have had to think about the types of halls they put together for the deaf.

85,"So, what I'm going to try and do in my lecture is go a little bit further and see if I can violate your expectations in a pleasing way. I want you to see how this illusion is constructed, and it's going to rotate so you see that it's inside out. This is what you would see. What do you see here? If you are a child under the age of 10 who haven't been ruined yet, you will look at this image and see dolphins. But in fact, if you reversed the figure ground -- in other words, the dark areas here -- I forgot to ask for a pointer -- but if you reverse it, you'll see a whole series of little dolphins. Now, something like this can be used because this is after all talk about design, too. Can you see this? You learn something in the sort of thing that I do, which is there are people out there with a lot of time on their hands. And that's something for you to think about, all right?","if you reverse the figure ground, you'll see a whole series of little dolphins. this is after all talk about design, too.","Al Seckel, an expert on illusions, explores the perceptual illusions that fool our brains.

86,"But if I had one thing to say about this, before we get to first, it would be that from the time we started building this, the big idea wasn't the technology. Over the last hundred years, we started building cars, and then over the 50 years we've connected every city to every other city in an extraordinarily efficient way, and we have a very high standard of living as a consequence of that. If five percent of that population became, quote, middle class, and wanted to go the way we've gone in the last hundred years at the same time that 50 percent of their population are moving into cities of the size and density of Manhattan, every six weeks -- it isn't sustainable environmentally; it isn't sustainable economically -- there just ain't enough oil -- and it's not sustainable politically. But rather than go license this off, which is what we normally do, it seemed to me that if we put all our effort not into the technology, but into an understanding of a world that's solved all its other problems, but has somehow come to accept that cities -- which, right back from ancient Greece on, were meant to walk around, cities that were architected and built for people -- now have a footprint that, while we've solved every other transportation problem -- and it's like Moore's law. So you wonder, what if cities could give to their pedestrians what we take for granted as we now go between cities? What if it would make it a little bit more palatable to have access via this, as that last link to mass transit, to get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbs and use our cars the way we want, and then have our cities energized again? Or maybe we should be out in the street in front of a Greyhound bus or a vehicle. But if I could ask you to do one thing, it's not to think about it as a piece of technology, but just imagine that, although we all understand somehow that it's reasonable that we use our 4,000-pound machine, which can go 60 miles an hour, that can bring you everywhere you want to go, and somehow it's also what we used for the last mile, and it's broken, and it doesn't work. (Applause) The bottom line is, whether you believe the United Nations, or any of the other think tanks -- in the next 20 years, all human population growth on this planet will be in cities. So if we put this box on here in a few years, could we have a solution to transportation, electricity, and communication, and maybe drinkable water in a sustainable package that weighs 60 pounds?","john avlon: from the time we started building this, the big idea wasn't the technology. avlon: it's not sustainable environmentally; it's not sustainable economically. avlon: if we put all our effort not into the technology, it's like Moore's law. avlon: if we put all our effort into an understanding of a world that's solved other problems.",Inventor Dean Kamen lays out his argument for the Segway and offers a peek into his next big ideas (portable energy and water purification for developing countries).
87,"(Laughter) So this is a mantis shrimp. And so what we did is, we took a look at these videos, and we measured how fast the limb was moving to get back to that original question. (Laughter) So, this -- what I saw, on every single mantis shrimp limb, whether it's a spearer or a smasher, is a beautiful saddle-shaped structure right on the top surface of the limb. And then we did a series of calculations, and what we were able to show is that these mantis shrimp have to have a spring. So we thought, OK, this must be a spring -- the saddle could very well be a spring. And so all I had to do was actually put a little shrimp paste on the front of the load cell, and they'd smash away at it. And so this is just a regular video of the animal just smashing the heck out of this load cell. And what that is, is cavitation. So this is a potent force in fluid systems, and just to sort of take it one step further, I'm going to show you the mantis shrimp approaching the snail. And what they do is, up until that time period when they can't strike, they become really obnoxious and awful, and they strike everything in sight; it doesn't matter who or what.",mantis shrimp have a saddle-shaped structure on every single limb. mantis shrimp have to have a spring. cavitation is a potent force in fluid systems.,"Biologist Sheila Patek talks about her work measuring the feeding strike of the mantis shrimp, one of the fastest movements in the animal world, using video cameras recording at 20,000 frames per second."

90,"And a sea that's just filled and teeming with jellyfish isn't very good for all the other creatures that live in the oceans, that is, unless you eat jellyfish. Now this is typically how you see sunfish, this is where they get their common name. So I was just intrigued with what -- you know, what is this animal's story? Now I don't know how you'd feed a child like that but -- we don't know how fast the Molas grow in the wild, but captive growth studies at the Monterey Bay Aquarium -- one of the first places to have them in captivity -- they had one that gained 800 lbs in 14 months. How do you do that with an animal -- very few places in the world. So the great thing about the Mola is that when we put the tag on them -- if you look up here -- that's streaming off, that's right where we put the tag. And we'd love to tag here -- this is an aerial shot of Monterey -- but unfortunately, the Molas here end up looking like this because another one of our locals really likes Molas but in the wrong way. And I'm not exaggerating, it is just -- and sometimes they don't eat them, it's just spiteful. And this is a day in the life of a Mola, and if we -- they're up and down, and up and down, and up and down, and up and up and down, up to 40 times a day.

91,"But, you know, we've just come from this discussion of what a bird might be. Someone heard the six hours of talk that I gave called ""The Monticello Dialogues"" on NPR, and sent me this as a thank you note -- ""We realize that design is a signal of intention, but it also has to occur within a world, and we have to understand that world in order to imbue our designs with inherent intelligence, and so as we look back at the basic state of affairs in which we design, we, in a way, need to go to the primordial condition to understand the operating system and the frame conditions of a planet, and I think the exciting part of that is the good news that's there, because the news is the news of abundance, and not the news of limits, and I think as our culture tortures itself now with tyrannies and concerns over limits and fear, we can add this other dimension of abundance that is coherent, driven by the sun, and start to imagine what that would be like to share."" So what are our intentions, and what would our intentions be -- if we wake up in the morning, we have designs on the world -- well, what would our intention be as a species now that we're the dominant species?

92,"So this is some of the challenge that we have here, is you can see that it's actually kind of hard to get the -- there we go. Now what I would like to do is just to show you what one second of this activity would look like. In fact, many of the organizations that are here -- the Acumen Fund, I think ApproTEC we have running, I'm not sure if that one's up yet -- and many of the people who have presented here are running through Google Grants. And Sergey mentioned Orkut, which is something that, you know, Orkut wanted to do in his time, and we call this -- at Google, we've embodied this as ""the 20 percent time,"" and the idea is, for 20 percent of your time, if you're working at Google, you can do what you think is the best thing to do. And I think many other things in the world also have come out of this.

And these are the inflection points that tell you what the next chapter in that technology's life is going to be, and maybe how you can do something about it. I'd like to demonstrate what I mean by this by telling the story of the DVD, which is a technology which has done all of these. The DVD, as you know, was introduced in the mid-1990s and it was quite expensive. I'd like to talk about some other technologies out there, just technologies on our radar -- and I'll use this lens, these four, as a way to kind of tell you where each one of those technologies is in its development. Here's another technology that's approaching a critical price. And the falling price of drugs has a lot to do with that. And if you look at the trends here, by about 2008 -- and I don't think this is a crazy forecast -- they'll be two percent of auto sales. And once you have electric motors, you can do anything: you can change the structure of the car in any way you want.

And we also, frankly, knew that if it didn't happen by the end of the Giuliani administration, then everyone who we were dealing with at the DOT and the Police Department and all of the -- we were meeting with 20 or 30 people with the city at a time, and it was set up by the Office of Emergency Management. So the first thing we had to do was find a way to get this -- we had to work with the families of the victims, through the city, to make sure that they knew this was happening. And I think this was the 21st, and we knew this had to be built and up by the 28th. There was no sense of the fact that this is next to Saint Paul -- that this is really a place that needs to be kind of dignified, and a place to reflect and remember.

111,"But this is about Africa, the story we have not heard. A part of my talk is going to be about investment opportunities that exist on this continent, to separate the rhetoric from the reality, the fact from the fiction. The lesson from that was that it was Africa -- an African story -- that was used to share news with the rest of the world of what the benchmark can be for corporate turnarounds. And the Siwa Oasis is famous for several things, but the key thing is that it was the place that Alexander the Great went to when he wanted to find out what his destiny had in store for him. And while Africa may be dark, the thing that brought the message home to me was that this is the challenge we are facing, but it's also the opportunity. Because whilst Africa may be dark -- other than the few specks that exist north and in the south and other areas -- it's aglow with the light in the hearts of the millions of people that are there. And the first myth to dispel is that Africa is not a country. But the story of Africa, and my focus, is beyond South Africa because there's so much happening. I want to talk about it from the perspective of capital markets. This time [I'll] give you the entire picture that I saw in 2002, and ask you that when you think about what your role can be in Africa, think about your journey in terms of bringing light to this continent.","the siwa oasis is famous for several things, but the key thing is that it was the place that Alexander the Great went to when he wanted to find out what his destiny had in store for him. while Africa may be dark, it's aglow with the light in the hearts of the millions of people that are there.",South African investment banker Euvin Naidoo explains why investing in Africa can make great business sense.
112,"We all have come from a long way, here in Africa, and converged in this region of Africa, which is a place where 90 percent of our evolutionary process took place. And I say that not because I am African, but it's in Africa that you find the earliest evidence for human ancestors, upright walking traces, even the first technologies in the form of stone tools. Because it's only when you do that, that you can talk about -- (Laughter) -- it's only when you do that, [that] you can talk about how we looked like and how we behaved at different times, and how those likes and looks and behaviors changed through time. Of course, they cannot, but I'm telling you already that the environment and the carrying capacity of this region was drastically different from what we have today. But to do that, you need the permanent dentition, which you don't see here, because what you have here are the baby teeth. And to know how old she was when she died, what you do is you do an informed estimate, and you say, how much time would be required to form this amount of teeth, and the answer was three. So, with all that information, the big question is -- what do we actually -- what does she tell us? What do we actually know about our ancestors? Of course, in addition to extracting this huge amount of scientific information as to what makes us human, you know, the many human ancestors that have existed over the past six million years -- and there are more than 10 -- they did not have the knowledge, the technology and sophistications that we, Homo sapiens, have today. So finally, I would like to say, so let's help Africa walk upright and forward, then we all can be proud of our future legacy as a species.","gene seymour: 90 percent of our evolutionary process took place in this region of africa. he says it's in this region that you find the earliest evidence for human ancestors. seymour: let's help africa walk upright and forward, then we can be proud of our legacy.",Paleoanthropologist Zeresenay Alemseged looks for the roots of humanity in Ethiopia's badlands.

Yesterday, a number of people -- Nicholas Negroponte and others -- spoke about all the wonderful things that are happening when our ideas get spread out, thanks to all the new technology all over the world.

The third fundamental issue that we have to recognize is that if we want to help the African people, we must know where the African people are.

120,"And while these are both wonderful things in their own right -- they both have very wonderful things going for them -- truth and beauty as ideals that can be looked at by the sciences and by math are almost like the ideal conjoined twins that a scientist would want to date. (Laughter) These are expressions of truth as awe-full things, by meaning they are things you can worship. Truth and beauty are things that are often opaque to people who are not in the sciences. If you look at the math, E=mc squared, if you look at the cosmological constant, where there's an anthropic ideal, where you see that life had to evolve from the numbers that describe the universe -- these are things that are really difficult to understand. And what I've tried to do since I had my training as a medical illustrator -- since I was taught animation by my father, who was a sculptor and my visual mentor -- I wanted to figure out a way to help people understand truth and beauty in the biological sciences by using animation, by using pictures, by telling stories so that the things that are not necessarily evident to people can be brought forth, and can be taught, and can be understood. And so what we wanted to do was to figure out how we could make this story into an animation that would be the centerpiece of BioVisions at Harvard, which is a website that Harvard has for its molecular and cellular biology students that will -- in addition to all the textual information, in addition to all the didactic stuff -- put everything together visually, so that these students would have an internalized view of what a cell really is in all of its truth and beauty, and be able to study with this view in mind, so that their imaginations would be sparked, so that their passions would be sparked and so that they would be able to go on and use these visions in their head to make new discoveries and to be able to find out, really, how life works. And figure out how to do this in a way that was truthful in that it imparted what was going on, but not so truthful that the compact crowding in a cell would prevent the vista from happening. But these machines that power the inside of the cells are really quite amazing, and they really are the basis of all life because all of these machines interact with each other.

124,"An average African country receives foreign aid to the tune of 13, 15 percent of its GDP, and that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources from rich countries to poor countries. But I want to say that there are two things we need to connect. What should we do with it? Ladies and gentlemen, can any one of you tell me a neighbor, a friend, a relative that you know, who became rich by receiving charity? Why should people support their government? But I want to put a caveat on my argument, and that caveat is that it is not true that aid is always destructive. Aid increases the resources available to governments, and that makes working in a government the most profitable thing you can have, as a person in Africa seeking a career. I also want to say that it is important for us to note that, over the last 50 years, Africa has been receiving increasing aid from the international community, in the form of technical assistance, and financial aid, and all other forms of aid. Between 1960 and 2003, our continent received 600 billion dollars of aid, and we are still told that there is a lot of poverty in Africa.

125,"This would be an example of how to do that. So which verbs go in which construction -- the problem with which I began -- depends on whether the verb specifies a kind of motion or a kind of possession change. You can think of this as the language of thought, or ""mentalese."" It seems to be based on a fixed set of concepts, which govern dozens of constructions and thousands of verbs -- not only in English, but in all other languages -- fundamental concepts such as space, time, causation and human intention, such as, what is the means and what is the ends? You can also say, ""Biff went from sick to well."" Second conclusion is that the ability to conceive of a given event in two different ways, such as ""cause something to go to someone"" and ""causing someone to have something,"" I think is a fundamental feature of human thought, and it's the basis for much human argumentation, in which people don't differ so much on the facts as on how they ought to be construed. And I think the biggest picture of all would take seriously the fact that so much of our verbiage about abstract events is based on a concrete metaphor and see human intelligence itself as consisting of a repertoire of concepts -- such as objects, space, time, causation and intention -- which are useful in a social, knowledge-intensive species, whose evolution you can well imagine, and a process of metaphorical abstraction that allows us to bleach these concepts of their original conceptual content -- space, time and force -- and apply them to new abstract domains, therefore allowing a species that evolved to deal with rocks and tools and animals, to conceptualize mathematics, physics, law and other abstract domains. For example, in polite requests, if someone says, ""If you could pass the guacamole, that would be awesome,"" we know exactly what he means, even though that's a rather bizarre concept being expressed. You want to express the bribe, the command, the promise, the solicitation and so on, but you also have to negotiate and maintain the kind of relationship you have with the other person. On the other hand, with indirect language, if you issue a veiled bribe, then the dishonest officer could interpret it as a bribe, in which case you get the payoff of going free.","""mentalese"" seems to be based on a fixed set of concepts, says dr. sanjay gupta. ability to conceive of a given event in two different ways is a fundamental feature of human thought. gupta: human intelligence itself is consisting of a repertoire of concepts.","In an exclusive preview of his book <i>The Stuff of Thought</i>, Steven Pinker looks at language and how it expresses what goes on in our minds -- and how the words we choose communicate much more than we realize."

129,"While it is true that those things are going on, there's an Africa that you don't hear about very much. And therefore, when you hear about the corrupt Africa -- corruption all the time -- I want you to know that the people and the governments are trying hard to fight this in some of the countries, and that some successes are emerging. But let me say this: if Alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in London -- if the other people who had taken money, estimated at 20 to 40 billion now of developing countries' monies sitting abroad in the developed countries -- if they're able to do this, what is that? We have to do it. And this is what we started to do in one of the largest countries on the continent, Nigeria. But there's a huge market out there, and people don't know about it, or they don't want to know. And what is more important, because we want to get away from oil and diversify -- and there are so many opportunities in this one big country, as in many countries in Africa -- what was remarkable is that much of this growth came not from the oil sector alone, but from non-oil. But you should know that this continent is not -- is a continent of many countries, not one country. And I want to say that some of the best people to invest in on the continent are the women. When you go to Tanzania, listen carefully, because I'm sure you will hear of the various openings that there will be for you to get involved in something that will do good for the continent, for the people and for yourselves.","alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in London. some of the best people to invest in on the continent are the women, he says. africa is not a continent of many countries, not one country, he says.","We know the negative images of Africa -- famine and disease, conflict and corruption.

130,"If you follow policy, you probably know that a few years ago the president pledged 15 billion dollars to fight the epidemic over five years, and a lot of that money is going to go to programs that try to replicate Uganda and use behavior change to encourage people and decrease the epidemic. So today I'm going to talk about some things that you might not know about the epidemic, and I'm actually also going to challenge some of these things that you think that you do know. I think it may seem like I'm ignoring the policy stuff, which is really the most important, but I'm hoping that at the end of this talk you will conclude that we actually cannot develop effective policy unless we really understand how the epidemic works. So this means that in a place with a lot of AIDS, there's a really significant cost of sex. But I'm going to argue that you shouldn't be surprised by this, and that to understand this you need to think about health the way than an economist does -- as an investment. So one way to test to see whether we can explain some of this behavior change by differences in life expectancy is to look and see is there more behavior change in areas where there's less malaria. Then if you poked a little more, you looked a little more at what was going on, you'd find that actually that was a pretty good year, because in some years the only people tested are IV drug users. And I think that the answer is, we can look at mortality data, and we can use mortality data to figure out what the prevalence was in the past. But it also tells us something about one of these things that we think that we know. So if you combine the intuition in this figure with some of the data that I talked about before, it suggests that somewhere between 25 percent and 50 percent of the decline in prevalence in Uganda actually would have happened even without any education campaign.",president obama pledged 15 billion dollars to fight the AIDS epidemic in Uganda. aaron carroll: we can't develop effective policy unless we really understand how the epidemic works. he says behavior change can be explained by differences in life expectancy in areas with less malaria. carroll: we can use mortality data to figure out what the prevalence was in the past.,Emily Oster re-examines the stats on AIDS in Africa from an economic perspective and reaches a stunning conclusion: Everything we know about the spread of HIV on the continent is wrong.

And, mostly because people never really ask you, and when they do, you don't really think they want to know the truth. Both of them live at the confluence of public health and enterprise, and both of them, because they're manufacturers, create jobs directly, and create incomes indirectly, because they're in the malaria sector, and Africa loses about 13 billion dollars a year because of malaria. And so, Anuj and Acumen have been talking about testing the private sector, because the assumption that the aid establishment has made is that, look, in a country like Tanzania, 80 percent of the population makes less than two dollars a day. And so we came in with a second round of patient capital to A to Z, a loan as well as a grant, so that A to Z could play with pricing and listen to the marketplace, and found a number of things.

Now, I just wanted to leave that slide up because it's important that we think about it.","an american friend of mine volunteered as a nurse in Ghana this year. she came to a conclusion about the state of leadership in africa that took me over a decade to reach. a month into it, i come to the office and have an email from one of our students.","A liberal arts education is critical to forming true leaders, says university head Patrick Awuah -- because it builds decision-making skills, an ethical framework and a broad vision.

141,"It's inevitable, terrible, but really what I want to talk about is, I'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die. That's what I want to talk about. And my father left me a legacy of his handwriting through letters and a notebook. In the last two years of his life, when he was sick, he filled a notebook with his thoughts about me. There are times when I want to trade all those years that I was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him, and trade all those years for one hug. But that's when I take out his letters and I read them, and the paper that touched his hand is in mine, and I feel connected to him. So maybe we all need to leave our children with a value legacy, and not a financial one. If a fraction of this powerful TED audience could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper -- John, it'll be a recycled one -- and write a beautiful letter to someone they love, we actually may start a revolution where our children may go to penmanship classes.

I mean you have become, whether you can giggle at it because it's a funny ... you know, it's a strange thought, but your building is an icon -- you can draw a little picture of that building, it can be used in ads -- and you've had not rock star status, but celebrity status in doing what you wanted to do for most of your life. That was my response to the people in the time.

And in the measure that we plant stuff, what we learn from agriculture is you've got to deal with pests, you've got to deal with all types of awful things, you've got to cultivate stuff. And as you do that stuff, here's what happens to productivity. One of the ironies of this whole system is we're discussing what to do about a system that we don't understand. It may be to have stuff process that coal in a biological fashion as you did in agriculture. What is this? And as you think about this stuff and what the implications of this are, we're going to start not just converting ethanol from corn with very high subsidies. Now, if you can take part of the energy content out of doing this, you reduce the system, and you really do start applying biological principles to energy. And be that oil, be that gas, be that coal, this is what we're dealing with.

But now, if it is something that is going to determine the quality of every instant of our life, then we better know what it is, have some clearer idea. And probably, the fact that we don't know that is why, so often, although we seek happiness, it seems we turn our back to it. And also, again, it can -- also, it's something that you -- it is not something that is radiating outside. Now, what, then, will be happiness?

It cannot be tainted intrinsically with hatred or jealousy because then, if it was always there -- like a dye that would permeate the whole cloth -- then it would be found all the time, somewhere. We think of people suffering, of people we love, but at some point, it can be a state which is all pervading.","we don't know what happiness is, so often we turn our back to it. happiness cannot be tainted intrinsically with hatred or jealousy. we think of people suffering, of people we love, but at some point, it can be a state.","What is happiness, and how can we all get some?

My view is that if you want to involve yourself in the life of people who have been given up on, you have to look like the solution and not the problem. And I happen to know that company pretty well because John Heinz, who was our U.S. senator -- who was tragically killed in a plane accident -- he had heard about my desire to build a new building, because I had a cardboard box and I put it in a garbage bag and I walking all over Pittsburgh trying to raise money for this site. I said, ""Senator, I'm reluctant to go into a field that I don't know much about, but I promise you that if you'll support my school, I'll get it built and in a couple of years, I'll come back and weigh out that program that you desire.""

148,"So if you look, you can see a lot of different machines come out of this. They all crawl in different ways, and you can see on the right, that we actually made a couple of these things, and they work in reality. These are not very fantastic robots, but they evolved to do exactly what we reward them for: for moving forward. So that was all done in simulation, but we can also do that on a real machine. And you can see these robots are not ready to take over the world yet, but they gradually learn how to move forward, and they do this autonomously. You look at it and you see it has four legs, the machine doesn't know if it's a snake, if it's a tree, it doesn't have any idea what it looks like, but it's going to try to find that out. It kind of figured out what it looks like, and how to move forward, and then actually tried that out. And we've actually built a couple of these, and this is part of a larger robot made out of these cubes. So of course, this is a very crude machine, but we're working on a micro-scale version of these, and hopefully the cubes will be like a powder that you pour in. And one of the things that I think is important is that we have to get away from this idea of designing the machines manually, but actually let them evolve and learn, like children, and perhaps that's the way we'll get there.","we're working on a micro-scale version of these robots. the robots are not ready to take over the world yet. they gradually learn how to move forward, and they do this autonomously.","Hod Lipson demonstrates a few of his cool little robots, which have the ability to learn, understand themselves and even self-replicate."

So now the thing is, this is a different kind of spell. And so, I'm here to tell you, you don't need a computer to actually have a spell. So then, we think we can do that. One of my first questions doing this was: How can you make an arbitrary shape or pattern out of DNA? I decided to use a type of DNA origami, where you take a long strand of DNA and fold it into whatever shape or pattern you might want. These short DNA sequences are what are going to fold the long strand into this shape that we want to make. So you get 250 of these in the mail in little tubes.

OK, the next thing is -- most of you, if you have a stable home life, and what I mean is that you don't travel all the time, and always in hotels, but most people have what we call a center of gravity. Just from a design perspective, we didn't really understand how they did it, and so that's just one small example of the kind of research that we were doing. If you go on the streets of India and China, you see this kind of stuff.

Let's say that we don't do geo-engineering, we do what we ought to do, which is get serious about cutting emissions. Right now, you have a few enthusiasts talking about it, some in a positive side, some in a negative side -- but that's a dangerous state to be in because there's very little depth of knowledge on this topic.

156,"The United States, for example, can completely eliminate its use of oil and rejuvenate the economy at the same time, led by business for profit, because it's so much cheaper to save and substitute for the oil than to keep on buying it. We can save half the oil by using it more efficiently, at a cost of 12 dollars per saved barrel. You can sort of have it all with these things. And the reason this has not been very seriously examined before is there was a common assumption in the industry that -- well, then it might not be safe if you got whacked by a heavy car, and it would cost a lot more to make, because the only way we know how to make cars much lighter was to use expensive light metals like aluminum and magnesium. And when you make them light in the right way, that can be simpler and cheaper to make. Now, when you go through a similar analysis for every way we use oil, including buildings, industry, feedstocks and so on, you find that of the 28 million barrels a day the government says we will need in 2025, well, about eight of that can be removed by efficiency by then, with another seven still being saved as the vehicle stocks turn over, at an average cost of only 12 bucks a barrel, instead of 26 for buying the oil. There is a huge amount of gas to be saved, about half the projected gas at about an eighth of its price. Or we could use the saved gas directly to cover all of this balance, or if we used it as hydrogen, which is more profitable and efficient, we'd get rid of the domestic oil too. And the one thing I'd like to point out here is that we've done this before.

It didn't work very well on the schizophrenics, but it was pretty clear in the '30s and by the middle of the '40s that electroconvulsive therapy was very, very effective in the treatment of depression. But it wasn't that simple, because by the time I got out of that unit, I was not functional at all. Well, I was a grown man who had all of these rituals, and it got so there was a throbbing, there was a ferocious fear in my head. But there was one treatment, which actually had been pioneered at the Hartford Hospital in the early 1940s, and you can imagine what it was: it was prefrontal lobotomy. (Imitates a popping sound) So they decided -- I didn't know this, again, I found this out later -- that the only thing that could be done was for this 43-year-old man to have a prefrontal lobotomy. He asked to meet with the senior staff, and they agreed to meet with him, because he was very well thought of in that place.

163,"(Laughter) There was a very important study done a while ago at Princeton Theological Seminary that speaks to why it is that when all of us have so many opportunities to help, we do sometimes, and we don't other times. What turned out to determine whether someone would stop and help a stranger in need was how much of a hurry they thought they were in -- were they feeling they were late, or were they absorbed in what they were going to talk about. I was doing my taxes the other day, and I got to the point where I was listing all of the donations I gave, and I had an epiphany, it was -- I came to my check to the Seva Foundation and I noticed that I thought, boy, my friend Larry Brilliant would really be happy that I gave money to Seva. I was at a sushi restaurant a while back and I overheard two women talking about the brother of one woman, who was in the singles scene. The test was: from the moment they got together, how long it would take the guy to ask her a question with the word ""you"" in it. There is a newly coined word in the English language for the moment when the person we're with whips out their BlackBerry or answers that cell phone, and all of a sudden we don't exist. So at one point, my brother-in-law gets up the courage to ask the one question he really wants to know the answer to, and that is: how could you have done it? And I think that that is very troubling, and in a sense, I've been reflecting on turning that part of us off. And all of a sudden as I was going down the stairs I noticed that there was a man slumped to the side, shirtless, not moving, and people were just stepping over him -- hundreds and hundreds of people. This guy was back on his feet immediately.","a study shows how much of a hurry people thought they were in determines whether they would help. a man slumped to the side, shirtless, not moving, and people were just stepping over him. he was back on his feet immediately.","Daniel Goleman, author of ""Emotional Intelligence,"" asks why we aren't more compassionate more of the time."

(Laughter) But that sure started me thinking about various things, and immediately, we began making a solar-powered plane because we felt solar power was going to be so important for the country and the world, we didn't want the small funding in the government to be decreased, which is what the government was trying to do with it.

167,"And all of these robotic missions are part of a bigger human journey: a voyage to understand something, to get a sense of our cosmic place, to understand something of our origins, and how Earth, our planet, and we, living on it, came to be. It has a very large, thick atmosphere, and in fact, its surface environment was believed to be more like the environment we have here on the Earth, or at least had in the past, than any other body in the solar system. And so it turns out that methane is to Titan what water is to the Earth. (Laughter) That is the view that we had of the surface of Titan before we got there with Cassini,   and I can tell you that what we have found on Titan, though it is not the same in detail, is every bit as fascinating as that story is. And what you see is bright and dark regions, and that's about as far as it got for us. This, we later found out, is, in fact, a crater, but there are very few craters on the surface of Titan, meaning it's a very young surface. It is so significant that, in my mind, this was an event that should have been celebrated with ticker tape parades in every city across the U.S. and Europe, and sadly, that wasn't the case. And I can't tell you what it was like to see the first pictures of Titan's surface from the probe.

But I also hope, because I think the people in this room can literally change the world, I hope you take some of this stuff away with you, and when you have an opportunity to be influential, that you try to get some heavy-duty money spent on some of these ideas. And with the kind of computing power we have now, there is, as I say, some of this going on, but it needs money. What can we do about this? But what happens, as this occurs, is that we lose our magnetic field around the Earth over the period of about 100 years, and that means that all these cosmic rays and particles that are to come streaming at us from the sun, that this field protects us from, are -- well, basically, we're gonna fry. You don't need that much up there. But the alarming thing is that astronomers recently have been studying stars that are similar to our Sun, and they've found that a number of them, when they're about the age of our Sun, brighten by a factor of as much as 20.

And then, for instance, this other exhibition that was entitled Workspheres in 2001, where I asked different designers to come up with ideas for the new type of work styles that were happening in the world at that time. But the interesting thing in the exhibition is the discovery that the ultimate shelter is your sense of self, and there are quite a few designers that are working on this particular topic.

176,"They go out, they get the food, they dig the nest, and the queen never comes out again. And then this is how colony size and numbers of worker ants changes -- so this is about 10,000 worker ants -- changes as a function of colony age, in years. That's not just how is the colony organized, but how does it change what it's doing? So you see the nest maintenance workers come out with a bit of sand, put it down, turn around, and go back in. So just to reinforce that what you might have thought about ant queens isn't true -- you know, even if the queen did have the intelligence to send chemical messages through this whole network of chambers to tell the ants outside what to do, there is no way that such messages could make it in time to see the shifts in the allocation of workers that we actually see outside the nest. And what I wanted to know was, ""OK, here's a situation where extra nest maintenance workers were recruited -- is this going to have any effect on the workers performing other tasks?"" So, for example, when there's extra nest maintenance work to do, it's not that the foragers switch over. And what we're learning is that an ant uses the pattern of its antennal contacts, the rate at which it meets ants of other tasks, in deciding what to do. They've gone out to do different tasks, and the rate at which they meet as they come in and out of the nest entrance determines, or influences, each ant's decision about whether to go out, and which task to perform.

178,"I then went on to make more comments on the media and press imagery, so I started making reference to media imagery -- made it grainy, shot through doorways and so on and so forth -- to titillate the public or the viewer further in terms of trying to make the viewer more aware of their own voyeurism. So, this is an image of Diana looking at Camilla kissing her husband, and this was a sequence of images. This is Jane Smith and Jo Bloggs, for instance, but you think it's Camilla and the Queen, and I'm fascinated how what you think is real isn't necessarily real. And that is the way, I think, that celebrity magazines work now: the more pictures you see of these celebrities, the more you feel you know them, but you don't know them and you want to know them further. And then I was sort of making imagery. Which I found very interesting that it was going full cycle: I was making comments about the press and about how we know facts and information only by media -- because we don't know the real people; very few of us know the real people -- but it was going back into the press and they were publicizing, effectively, my filthy work. And me as the Queen. She looks nothing like Marilyn, but by the time we've made her up and put wigs and makeup on, she looks exactly like Marilyn, to the extent that her husband couldn't recognize her -- or recognize this look-alike -- in these photographs, which I find quite interesting. And I think it doesn't really matter that my work is considered humorous, in a way; I think it's a way in for me to deal with the importance of imagery and how we read all our information through imagery. I mean, it's extremely difficult to find these look-alikes, so I'm constantly going up to people in the street and trying to ask people to come and be in one of my photographs or films.","the queen looks nothing like Marilyn, but by the time we've made her up, she looks exactly like Marilyn. i'm constantly going up to people in the street and trying to ask people to come and be in one of my photographs.","By making photographs that seem to show our favorite celebs (Diana, Elton John) doing what we really, secretly, want to see them doing, Alison Jackson explores our desire to get personal with celebs.

179,"This is your conference, and I think you have a right to know a little bit right now, in this transition period, about this guy who's going to be looking after it for you for a bit. It's called Future; it was a magazine publishing company. I thought the little graph of my business life that kind of looked a bit like Moore's Law -- ever upward and to the right -- it was going to go on forever. And the way in which you could think about us as a species and us as a planet had just changed so much, and it was incredibly exciting. And what was really most exciting -- and I think Richard Wurman discovered this at least 20 years before I did -- was that all this stuff is connected. And when you think about it, it's very true: what we all most desire is a penis -- or ""happiness"" as we say in English. (Laughter) (Applause) But something as basic as happiness, which 20 years ago would have been just something for discussion in the church or mosque or synagogue, today it turns out that there's dozens of TED-like questions that you can ask about it, which are really interesting. And so on, and so on. (Laughter) So, I gave myself the job title of TED Custodian for a reason, and I will promise you right here and now that the core values that make TED special are not going to be interfered with. Already, just in the last few days, we've had so many people talking about stuff that they care about, that they're passionate about, that can make a difference in the world, and the idea of getting this group of people together -- some of the causes that we believe in, the money that this conference can raise and the ideas -- I really believe that that combination will, over time, make a difference.","john avlon: what we all most desire is a penis -- or ""happiness"" avlon: today there's dozens of TED-like questions that you can ask about happiness. he says the core values that make TED special are not going to be interfered with. avlon: if you want to make a difference in the world, you need a TED custodian.","Chris Anderson gave this talk in 2002, prior to taking over leadership of TED.

180,"In a few months, the world is also going to celebrate the launch of a new invention from Microsoft Research, which I think is going to have as profound an impact on the way we view the universe as Galileo did four centuries ago. It's called the WorldWide Telescope, and I want to thank TED and Microsoft for allowing me to bring it to your attention. It's going to change the way we do astronomy, it's going to change the way we teach astronomy and I think most importantly it's going to change the way we see ourselves in the universe. In 1920, for example, you weren't allowed to drink; if you were a woman, you weren't allowed to vote; and if you looked up at the stars and the Milky Way on a summer night, what you saw was thought to be the entire universe. We see alien worlds, we see alien solar systems -- 300 now, and still counting -- and they're not like us. And in telling stories, each of us is going to understand the universe in our own way. Before I introduce the person responsible for the WorldWide Telescope, I just want to leave you with this brief thought: when I ask people, ""How does the night sky make you feel?"" And thanks to the creators of the WorldWide Telescope, we can now start to have a dialogue with the universe. (Applause) I can't tell you what a privilege it is to introduce Curtis Wong from Microsoft. And the tours are all totally interactive, so that if I were to go somewhere ... you may be watching a tour and you can pause anywhere along the way, pull up other information -- there are lots of Web and information sources about places you might want to go -- you can zoom in, you can pull back out.","in a few months, the world is going to celebrate the launch of a new invention from Microsoft Research. it's called the WorldWide Telescope, and i want to thank TED and Microsoft for allowing me to bring it to your attention. it's going to change the way we do astronomy, it's going to change the way we teach astronomy.","Educator Roy Gould and researcher Curtis Wong show a sneak preview of Microsoft's WorldWide Telescope, which compiles images from telescopes and satellites to build a comprehensive, interactive view of our universe."
181,"At the end of lunch, they untie the anchor, they set off through the Baths of Caracalla and over the walls of the city and then an abandoned gatehouse and decide to take one more look at the Pyramid of Cestius, which has this lightning rod on top. Unfortunately, that's a problem: they get a little too close, and when you're in a dirigible you have to be very careful about spikes. So I thought, well, I'll just do piazzas, and I'll get inside and underneath and I'll show these things growing and show why they're shaped the way they are and so on. I could peel out a page of this palazzo to show you what's going on inside of it. OK, if I don't open the book the whole way, if I just open it 90 degrees, we're looking down the front of the Pantheon, and we're looking sort of at the top, more or less down on the square. But it would be a journey that went through Rome and showed all the things that I like about Rome. So it's a homeless pigeon now and it's going to have to find another place to live, and that allows me to go through my catalog of favorite things, and we start with the tall ones and so on. So, these are all title pages that eventually led me to the solution I settled on, which is the story of a young woman who sends a message on a homing pigeon -- she lives outside the walls of the city of Rome -- to someone in the city. If you see the red line, you are seeing the trail of the pigeon; if you don't see the red line, you are the pigeon. And then we can swoop inside and around; and because we're flying, we don't really have to worry about gravity at this particular moment in time, so this drawing can be oriented in any way on the page.","a young woman sends a message on a homing pigeon to someone in the city of Rome. if you see the red line, you are the trail of the pigeon; if you don't see the red line, you are the pigeon. because we're flying, we don't really have to worry about gravity at this particular moment in time.","David Macaulay relives the winding and sometimes surreal journey toward the completion of Rome Antics, his illustrated homage to the historic city."
182,"We have a grammar that suggests that's who we are; that we are sovereign subjects in nature, the bee as well as me. And that's when I got the idea, which was, ""Well, what would happen if we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who are working on us?"" And I realized that in the same way you can look at a flower and deduce all sorts of interesting things about the taste and the desires of bees -- that they like sweetness, that they like this color and not that color, that they like symmetry -- what could we find out about ourselves by doing the same thing? (Laughter) We have this intellectual, this Darwinian revolution in which, thanks to Darwin, we figured out we are just one species among many; evolution is working on us the same way it's working on all the others; we are acted upon as well as acting; we are really in the fiber, the fabric of life. So when you look at the plants, you realize that there are other tools and they're just as interesting. And I'm going to take you to a farm right now, because I used this idea to develop my understanding of the food system and what I learned, in fact, is that we are all, now, being manipulated by corn. Let me take you to a very different kind of farm. And this is a lot more than growing food, as you'll see; this is a different way to think about nature and a way to get away from the zero-sum notion, the Cartesian idea that either nature's winning or we're winning, and that for us to get what we want, nature is diminished. And what I realized when I understood this -- and if you ask Joel Salatin what he is, he'll tell you he's not a chicken farmer, he's not a sheep farmer, he's not a cattle rancher; he's a grass farmer, because grass is really the keystone species of such a system -- is that, if you think about it, this completely contradicts the tragic idea of nature we hold in our heads, which is that for us to get what we want, nature is diminished. And what it tells you is that if you begin to take account of other species, take account of the soil, that even with nothing more than this perspectival idea -- because there is no technology involved here except for those fences, which are so cheap they could be all over Africa in no time -- that we can take the food we need from the Earth and actually heal the Earth in the process.","gene seymour: we are all, now, being manipulated by corn. he says this is a different way to think about nature and a way to get away from zero-sum notion. seymour: it contradicts tragic idea of nature we hold in our heads that for us to get what we want, nature is diminished.",What if human consciousness isn't the end-all and be-all of Darwinism?

184,"Not only do I have a fleet of cars available to me in seven cities around the world that I can have at my beck and call, but heaven forbid I would ever maintain or deal with the repair or have anything to do with it. So, what is the social result of this? You know it's going to really transform how we feel about travel, and it will also, I think, enhance our freedom of mobility. And it's the cost of driving that's making people want to be able to do this. In London, the day they turned the congestion pricing on, there was a 25 percent decrease in congestion overnight, and that's persisted for the four years in which they've been doing congestion pricing. And as we get our cars more fuel-efficient, that's going to be reducing the amount of revenue that you get off of those gas taxes, so we need to charge people by the mile that they drive. When are we going to do it? Are we going to wait 10 to 15 years for this to happen or are we going to finally have this political will to make it happen in the next two years? So, the examples that I gave you are these islands of mesh networks, and networks are interesting only as they are big. When are we going to do it?","cost of driving is making people want to be able to do this, says john sutter. sutter: we need to charge people by the mile that they drive. he says we need to charge people by the mile. sutter: it's going to transform how we feel about travel.","Robin Chase founded Zipcar, the worldâ€™s biggest car-sharing business.

185,"We're actually starting at a new point: we've been digitizing biology, and now we're trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthesizing life. This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, that has the smallest genome for a species that can self-replicate in the laboratory, and we've been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome. We're able to knock out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here. There are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of DNA -- 30 to 50 letters in length -- and it's a degenerate process, so the longer you make the piece, the more errors there are. Part of the design is designing pieces that are 50 letters long that have to overlap with all the other 50-letter pieces to build smaller subunits we have to design so they can go together. And we started making pieces, starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7,000 letters, put those together to make 24,000-letter pieces, then put sets of those going up to 72,000. With bacteria and Archaea, the chromosome is integrated into the cell, but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it. Now I've argued, this is not genesis; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution. We're about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years. We now, from our discovery around the world, have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think of these as the design components of the future.","we've been digitizing biology, and now we're trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology. we're about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years. we now have a database with about 20 million genes, and we think of them as the design components of the future.","""Can we create new life out of our digital universe?""

186,"How do you discover the uniqueness of a project as unique as a person? And so I'll take you to Wichita, Kansas, where I was asked some years ago to do a science museum on a site, right downtown by the river. (Laughter) And so the process began and they said, ""You can't put it all on an island; some of it has to be on the mainland because we don't want to turn our back to the community."" It was, what I would say, compositional complexity, and I felt that if I had to fulfill what I talked about -- a building for science -- there had to be some kind of a generating idea, some kind of a generating geometry. I worked on it for months and I couldn't deal with it because I felt people were coming out of the historic museum, they are totally saturated with information and to see yet another museum with information, it would make them just unable to digest. And as you come from the north, it is all masonry growing out of the sand cliffs as you come from the Himalayas and evoking the tradition of the fortress. And all of it, then, all the galleries are underground, and you see the openings for the light. That too was a competition, and it is something I'm just beginning to work on. If it were to be anywhere in Washington, it would be an office building, a conference center, a place for negotiating peace and so on -- all of which the building is -- but by virtue of the choice of putting it on the Mall and by the Lincoln Memorial, this becomes the structure that is the symbol of peace on the Mall. And what I felt about that building is that it really was a building that had to do with a lightness of being -- to quote Kundera -- that it had to do with whiteness, it had to do with a certain dynamic quality and it had to do with optimism.","a science museum in wichita, kansas, is the symbol of peace on the mall. curator: ""it really was a building that had to do with a certain dynamic quality and it had to do with optimism"" curator: ""it's a building that has to do with a certain dynamic quality and it had to do with optimism""","Looking back over his long career, architect Moshe Safdie delves into four of his design projects and explains how he labored to make each one truly unique for its site and its users."

(Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo) (Laughter) It's kind of a funny, goofy sound to do. And sometimes if I have too much coffee, then my vibrato gets out of hand. It reminds me of the balancing act earlier on -- what Michael was doing -- because you're fighting so hard to keep the balance with what you're playing with and stay in tune, and at the same time you don't want to focus so much on being in tune all the time; you want to be feeling the music. And then also, you're trying to stay very, very, very still because little movements with other parts of your body will affect the pitch, or sometimes if you're holding a low note -- (Tone rising out of key) -- and breathing will make it ... (Laughter)  If I pass out on the next song ... (Laughter) I think of it almost like like a yoga instrument because it makes you so aware of every little crazy thing your body is doing, or just aware of what you don't want it to be doing while you're playing; you don't want to have any sudden movements. It really does reflect the mood that you're in also, if you're ... it's similar to being a vocalist, except instead of it coming out of your throat, you're controlling it just in the air and you don't really have a point of reference; you're always relying on your ears and adjusting constantly. You just have to always adjust to what's happening and realize you'll have bummer notes come here and there and listen to it, adjust it, and just move on, or else you'll get too tied up and go crazy.","a lot of kids today will make reference to a theremin by going, ""Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo"" if they have too much coffee, then my vibrato gets out of hand.

So one day, the scouts came running and told the villagers, ""The enemies are coming. So, this was told to me in a setup of elders. And that man told me, ""So, here you are. You've got a good education from America, you have a good life in America; what are you going to do for us? Every time you go to an area where for 43 years of independence, we still don't have basic health facilities. And I came for them, and that's my goal.","when i was seven, i found a man who gave me a scholarship to the united states. scouts came running and told the villagers, ""the enemies are coming,"" he says. scouts: ""i came for them, and that's my goal""","Joseph Lekuton, a member of parliament in Kenya, starts with the story of his remarkable education, then offers a parable of how Africa can grow.

And that's the structure of the city of Curitiba. We started in '83, proposing for the city of Rio how to connect the subway with the bus. And this is the model, how it's going to work. I'm trying to say we have to combine all the systems, and with one condition: never -- if you have a subway, if you have surface systems, if you have any kind of system -- never compete in the same space. I would like to say, if we want to have a sustainable world we have to work with everything what's said, but don't forget the cities and the children. So, in a city, you have to work fast. So, I want just to end saying that you can always propose new materials -- new sustainable materials -- but keep in mind that we have to work fast to the end, because we don't have the whole time to plan.

He was ostracized as a child, not because he was a Jew -- his parents weren't very religious anyhow -- but because he had been born with two club feet, a condition which, in those days, required institutionalization and a succession of painful operations between the ages of one and 11. He went to the commercial business high school as a young man in Budapest, and there he was as smart as he was modest and he enjoyed a considerable success. And then one day, it happened: he and his family were arrested and they were taken to a death house on the Danube. And one of the white foremen stepped forward and said, ""You are being paid twice the wages of any other workers in this industry in this region and this is how we do business.

It was only after Mr. Teszler's death that I learned that the marker on the grave of Bela Bartok in Hartsdale, New York was paid for by Sandor Teszler.

And, for example, if you're in a school that doesn't have a lot money, probably a lot of schools, or if you're in an office environment, and you want an interactive whiteboard, normally these cost about two to three thousand dollars. Now, what this means is that if I run this piece of software, the camera sees the infrared dot, and I can register the location of the camera pixels to the projector pixels.

204,"I mean, all the projects which have, in some way, been inspired by that agenda are about a celebratory lifestyle, in a way celebrating the places and the spaces which determine the quality of life. And I think it was July 20, 1969, when, for the first time, man could look back at planet Earth. So the problems of sustainability cannot be separated from the nature of the cities, of which the buildings are a part. If I pull back from that global picture, and I look at the implication over a similar period of time in terms of the technology -- which, as a tool, is a tool for designers, and I cite our own experience as a company, and I just illustrate that by a small selection of projects -- then how do you measure that change of technology? The image at the top, what it doesn't -- if you look at it in detail, really what it is saying is you can wire this building.

207,"But music is even more powerful if you don't just listen to it, but you make it yourself.

211,"Is this the face of Leonardo da Vinci or isn't it? His contemporaries made faces, like the ones you see here -- en face or three-quarters.

And we know from his contemporaries that Leonardo was a very handsome, even beautiful man. All we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self-portrait, and look, they are very similar. And as you see here from the years that they were created, it is indeed the case. So we have three pictures, potentially of the same person of the same age as Leonardo at the time.

Easy to repair, and because of that, we do not take things that are not durable and cannot last. This is at the Heart Institute. We don't have that luxury, so we have to make it happen. It's not possible to tell people to do what is going to be expensive, and they go home and can't do it. If you don't get this pacemaker, you will be dead. This is how we can do that. And anyone who is interested in doing it in any health care situation, we will be happy to assist you and tell you how we've done it, and how you can do it.","heart institute has every modality that can be done in the united states. easy to repair, we do not take things that are not durable and cannot last. if you don't get this pacemaker, you will be dead, heart institute says.","Dr. Ernest Madu runs the Heart Institute of the Caribbean in Kingston, Jamaica, where he proves that -- with careful design, smart technical choices, and a true desire to serve -- it's possible to offer world-class healthcare in the developing world."
213,"And that's what I want to talk about today, and how that relates to the emergence of social production. What this means is that for the first time since the industrial revolution, the most important means, the most important components of the core economic activities -- remember, we are in an information economy -- of the most advanced economies, and there more than anywhere else, are in the hands of the population at large. One was a motley collection of volunteers who just decided, you know, we really need this, we should write one, and what are we going to do with what -- well, we're gonna share it! So, NASA, at some point, did an experiment where they took images of Mars that they were mapping, and they said, instead of having three or four fully trained Ph.D.s doing this all the time, let's break it up into small components, put it up on the Web, and see if people, using a very simple interface, will actually spend five minutes here, 10 minutes there, clicking. This is what you'll find out about Barbie. This, on the other hand, is what 60,000 passionate volunteers produce in the Open Directory Project, each one willing to spend an hour or two on something they really care about, to say, this is good. When you think of what is the critical innovation of Google, the critical innovation is outsourcing the one most important thing -- the decision about what's relevant -- to the community of the Web as a whole, doing whatever they want to do: so, page rank. But it's not the only one. It is about the future of the freedom to be as social beings with each other, and the way information, knowledge and culture will be produced. Because it is in this context that we see a battle over how easy or hard it will be for the industrial information economy to simply go on as it goes, or for the new model of production to begin to develop alongside that industrial model, and change the way we begin to see the world and report what it is that we see.","for the first time since the industrial revolution, the most important means are in the hands of the population at large. a battle over how easy or hard it will be for the industrial information economy to go on as it goes. google's critical innovation is outsourcing the decision about what's relevant to the community of the Web as a whole.",Yochai Benkler explains how collaborative projects like Wikipedia and Linux represent the next stage of human organization.
214,"And then I'll come back to the beginning, and tell you a little bit more -- hopefully convince you -- that I believe that in today's world, it is really important for business leaders not only to have an idea of what their business is all about, but to have a passion for something that is meaningful. But one of the things that exposed me early to learning, and a tremendous curiosity that was instilled in me as a child, was through a technology which is on the screen -- is a Victrola. So, when you look at that, we said, well, we would like to, then, enable that a little bit. And a couple of years ago at AMD, we came up with this idea of saying, what if we create this initiative we call 50x15, where we are going to aim, that by the year 2015, half of the world will be connected to the Internet so that people and ideas can get connected. And when we embarked in this initiative, from the very beginning we said it very clearly: this is not a charity. What I mean by that, and let me use this example, the country of South Africa, because I was just there, therefore I'm a little bit familiar with some of the challenges they have. But to give you an idea how creative this group of people can be, one of the objectives of the One Laptop per Child is to be able to achieve a 10-hour battery life. I'll tell you that one of the things that I feel is really critical for us in industry, in business, is to be able to be passionate about solving these problems. I really believe that you have to have a passion for it. And then a few years later, I had a child, my first child, and again, my father comes to the hospital, and we're looking at the glass, and see all the children on the other side, and he said, ""I've got to remind you again, that for each generation to do better, you're going to have to be a better father than I was.""","one laptop per child aims to be able to achieve a 10-hour battery life. john sutter: it's really important for business leaders to have a passion for something meaningful. sutter: ""for each generation to do better, you're going to have to be a better father than I was""","Hector Ruiz, the executive chair of AMD, wants to give Internet access to everyone.

215,"And then, I also wasn't really shining in a certain area that I wanted to be, and you know, you look at those scores, and it wasn't bad, but it was not certainly predictive that I would one day make my living out of the artful arrangement of words. But actually, there was something quite real in my life that happened when I was about 14. And there's the terrible and dreaded observer effect, in which you're looking for something, and you know, things are happening simultaneously, and you're looking at it in a different way, and you're trying to really look for the about-ness, or what is this story about. Do we stay in for life, or do we do something else and justify and say, well, my intentions were good, and therefore I cannot be held responsible for all of it? So I decided that I would go to Burma for my own intentions, and still didn't know that if I went there, what the result of that would be, if I wrote a book -- and I just would have to face that later, when the time came. When I look at all these things that are morally ambiguous and uncomfortable, and I consider what my intentions should be, I realize it goes back to this identity question that I had when I was a child -- and why am I here, and what is the meaning of my life, and what is my place in the universe? My mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book, because it seemed I knew things I was not supposed to know. But I do think there's a kind of serendipity, and I do want to know what those elements are, so I can thank them, and also try to find them in my life. So I remained with them, and the more I wrote that story, the more I got into those beliefs, and I think that's important for me -- to take on the beliefs, because that is where the story is real, and that is where I'm gonna find the answers to how I feel about certain questions that I have in life. We've come to the end of the talk, and I will reveal what is in the bag, and it is the muse, and it is the things that transform in our lives, that are wonderful and stay with us.","sally kohn: there was something quite real in my life that happened when i was 14. kohn: i decided that i would go to burma for my own intentions, and still didn't know if I would write a book. kohn: the more i wrote that story, the more I got into those beliefs.","Novelist Amy Tan digs deep into the creative process, looking for hints of how hers evolved."

We've lost our sense of outrage, our anger and our grief about what's going on in our culture right now, what's going on in our country, the atrocities that are being committed in our names around the world. And one of the causes of this, I think, is that as each of us attempts to build this new kind of worldview, this holoptical worldview, this holographic image that we're all trying to create in our mind of the interconnection of things: the environmental footprints 1,000 miles away of the things that we buy; the social consequences 10,000 miles away of the daily decisions that we make as consumers.

226,"So first of all, I'd like to say something about memetics and the theory of memes, and secondly, how this might answer questions about who's out there, if indeed anyone is. What Darwin said was something like this: if you have creatures that vary, and that can't be doubted -- I've been to the Galapagos, and I've measured the size of the beaks and the size of the turtle shells and so on, and so on. If there's something that is copied with variation and it's selected, then you must get design appearing out of nowhere. Now, what's this to do with memes? SB: Sink, toilet, yes, these are all memes, they're all memes, but they're sort of useful ones, and then there's this one. (Laughter) What is this all about? So, you get an arms race between the genes which are trying to get the humans to have small economical brains and not waste their time copying all this stuff, and the memes themselves, like the sounds that people made and copied -- in other words, what turned out to be language -- competing to get the brains to get bigger and bigger. We have a new kind of memes now. We put the storage of memes out there on a clay tablet, but in order to get true temes and true teme machines, you need to get the variation, the selection and the copying, all done outside of humans. I have no idea.","the theory of memes might answer questions about who's out there, if indeed anyone is. we have a new kind of memes now. we need to get the variation, selection and copying, all done outside of humans.","Susan Blackmore studies memes: ideas that replicate themselves from brain to brain like a virus.

But part of the reason I found this interesting is, I started noticing that we're very aware of all the species that are going extinct on the planet as a result of human habitation expansion, and no one seems to be paying attention to all the species that are actually living; they're surviving. And as I started looking at them, I was finding that they had hyper-adapted. But what was really interesting to me was to find out that the birds were adapting in a pretty unusual way. Then they leave, the machine spits up more coins and peanuts, and life is dandy if you're a crow -- you can come back anytime and get yourself a peanut. So when they get really used to that, we move on to the crows coming back. Now they're used to the sound of the machine; they keep coming back and digging out peanuts from the pile of coins that's there. The crows learn that all they have to do is show up, wait for the coin to come out, put it in the slot, then get their peanut. So, what's significant about this to me isn't that we can train crows to pick up peanuts.","a vending machine is being built for crows to get peanuts from piles of coins. crows learn to wait for coin to come out, put it in slot, then get their peanut. crows are adapting in a pretty unusual way, author says.","Hacker and writer Joshua Klein is fascinated by crows.

(Laughter) The next piece that is going to come up is an example of a kind of machine that is fairly complex. And because the wishbone is bone -- it's animal -- it's sort of a point where I think we can enter into it. And -- so the way I saw this in my mind at first, was that the pieces would explode up and out with infinite speed, and the pieces would move far out, and then they would begin to be pulled back with a kind of a gravitational feel, to the point where they would approach infinite speed back to the center. There are 12 pairs of 50:1 reductions, so that means that the final speed of that gear on the end is so slow that it would take two trillion years to turn once.

And lo and behold, when he went through the data, he found that it didn't look like the expensive, complicated solution was any better than the cheap one, at least for the children who were two and older -- the cheap one still didn't work on the kids who were younger. And the other logic, they say, ""Well, the government wouldn't have told us [to] use them if they weren't much better."" Here, they don't actually crash the entire car, you know -- it's not worth ruining a whole car to do it.

The funny thing is, the cam work is terrible because they've only set it up to do the car seats, and so, they actually don't even have a way to move the camera so you can see the kid that's on the rebound. And I just think that it's interesting that the idea of using real-world crashes, which is very much something that economists think would be the right thing to do, is something that scientists don't actually, usually think -- they would rather use a laboratory, a very imperfect science of looking at the dummies, than actually 30 years of data of what we've seen with children and with car seats.

231,"I mean, it was incredible, it worked incredibly well, but it was really dangerous. And so I got myself a job and I was working for a consultancy, and we would get in to these meetings, and these managers would come in, and they would say, ""Well, what we're going to do here is really important, you know."" It wasn't what I wanted to do. So, all of these projects have a humanistic sense to them, and I think as designers we need to really think about how we can create a different relationship between our work and the world, whether it's for business, or, as I'm going to show, on some civic-type projects. But the other thing that is humanistic about Jawbone is that we really decided to take out all the techie stuff, and all the nerdy stuff out of it, and try to make it as beautiful as we can. This is the board, this is one of the things that goes inside that makes this technology work. And this is -- the other new way that is unique in how we work is, because it's never done, you have to do all this other stuff.

233,"By the time the last Neanderthal disappeared in Europe, 27,000 years ago, our direct ancestors had already, and for 5,000 years, been crawling into the belly of the earth, where in the light of the flickers of tallow candles, they had brought into being the great art of the Upper Paleolithic. They said, at one point, you know, we don't really believe you went to the moon, but you did. And if we move from the realm of the spirit to the realm of the physical, to the sacred geography of Peru -- I've always been interested in the relationships of indigenous people that literally believe that the Earth is alive, responsive to all of their aspirations, all of their needs. All that time, the world only exists as an abstraction, as they are taught the values of their society.

It doesn't work for me to go on with this thing, with such a wide gulf between those who understand, love and are passionate about classical music, and those who have no relationship to it at all. So that's what we're going to do. Now, you notice that there is not the slightest doubt in my mind that this is going to work, if you look at my face, right?

So the great thing about 2006, there's a lot of really great computational work you can do. We proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong. We brought in a team from the UK -- a lot of great refrigeration people, it turns out, in the UK -- and built a test rig, and proved that, in fact, we could make a low-pressure, nontoxic refrigerator.

239,"And this is the one that I work on, ATLAS. So it's in that same sense that we look back in time to understand what the universe is made of. And, as of today, it's made of these things. One of the wonderful things, actually, I find, is that we've discovered any of them, when you realize how tiny they are. This is it. The analogy is that these people in a room are the Higgs particles.

But in the last few minutes, I just want to give you a different perspective of what I think -- what particle physics really means to me -- particle physics and cosmology. And that's that I think it's given us a wonderful narrative -- almost a creation story, if you'd like -- about the universe, from modern science over the last few decades.

242,"So, I'd like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions. But Einstein realized that Newton had left something out of the story, because even Newton had written that although he understood how to calculate the effect of gravity, he'd been unable to figure out how it really works. Number one: if there are more dimensions in space, where are they? And the idea that maybe the big dimensions around us are the ones that we can easily see, but there might be additional dimensions curled up, sort of like the circular part of that cable, so small that they have so far remained invisible. Some of you guys will fix that one day, but anything that's not flat on a screen is a new dimension, goes smaller, smaller, smaller, and way down in the microscopic depths of space itself, this is the idea, you could have additional curled up dimensions -- here is a little shape of a circle -- so small that we don't see them. Well, it turns out that Einstein and Kaluza and many others worked on trying to refine this framework and apply it to the physics of the universe as was understood at the time, and, in detail, it didn't work. The idea is like this. (Laughter) But it raises the question: are we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions, or do they tell us something about the world? So when we talk about the extra dimensions in string theory, it's not one extra dimension, as in the older ideas of Kaluza and Klein. And the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like, then the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us would look like this on the tiniest of scales.","jay parini: Einstein realized that Newton had left something out of the story. parini: if there are more dimensions in space, where are they? he says it raises the question: are we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions, or do they tell us something? parini: if the extra dimensions look like this, the landscape of our universe would look like this.","Physicist Brian Greene explains superstring theory, the idea that minscule strands of energy vibrating in 11 dimensions create every particle and force in the universe."

(Applause) I then think that we can make the argument that we should save the old-growth forest as a matter of national defense. So, I went to the EPA homepage, and they were recommending studies with metarhizium species of a group of fungi that kill carpenter ants, as well as termites. These are spores -- this is in their spores. But the insects aren't stupid, and they would avoid the spores when they came close, and so I morphed the cultures into a non-sporulating form. I then received my second patent -- and this is a big one. These are a species that we need to join with.","john avlon: fungi kill carpenter ants, termites, carpenter ants. avlon: he morphed the cultures into a non-sporulating form. avlon: fungi are a species that we need to join with.","Mycologist Paul Stamets lists 6 ways the mycelium fungus can help save the universe: cleaning polluted soil, making insecticides, treating smallpox and even flu viruses."
244,"Now I put those names in there just for the bacteria buffs, but the main point here is that -- (Laughter) there's a lot of them here, I can tell -- the main point here is that those data points all show a very strong, positive association between the degree to which a disease organism is transmitted by water, and how harmful they are, how much death they cause per untreated infection. Other countries, in which you've got a lot of waterborne transmission, there you expect these organisms to evolve towards a high level of harmfulness, right? Just to emphasize this, this is what we're really talking about. Now, I don't know how that happened, and I didn't have anything to do with it, I promise you. And to just give you a sense of how important this might be, if we look in 1995, we find that there's only one case of cholera, on average, reported from Chile every two years. And the example I want to deal with is, or the idea I want to deal with, the question is, what can we do to try to get the malarial organism to evolve to mildness? So, if you were to mosquito proof houses, you should be able to get these organisms to evolve to mildness. And all I'm saying is that we need to figure out how they'll evolve, so that -- we need to adjust our interventions to get the most bang for the intervention buck, so that we can get these organisms to evolve in the direction we want them to go. So, I don't really have time to talk about those things, but I did want to put them up there, just to give you a sense that there really are solutions to controlling the evolution of harmfulness of some of the nasty pathogens that we're confronted with. If we know that we're going to get extra bang for the buck from providing clean water, then I think that we can say, let's push the effort into that aspect of the control, so that we can actually solve the problem, even though, if you just look at the frequency of infection, you would suggest that you can't solve the problem well enough just by cleaning up water supply.","there's only one case of cholera, on average, reported from Chile every two years. we need to adjust our interventions to get the most bang for the buck. if we know that we're going to get extra bang for the buck from providing clean water.","Evolutionary biologist Paul Ewald drags us into the sewer to discuss germs.

251,"I want to talk about something quite different, which is what I know about, and that is astronomy. Particularly, there's a place called Europa, which is -- Europa is one of the moons of Jupiter, where we see a very level ice surface, which looks as if it's floating on top of an ocean. There is a -- imagine that life originated on Europa, and it was sitting in the ocean for billions of years. So they would have to have -- these creatures, which I call sunflowers, which I imagine living on the surface of Europa, would have to have either lenses or mirrors to concentrate sunlight, so they could keep themselves warm on the surface. Of course, it's not very likely that there's life on the surface of Europa. So, the same thing could be true for this kind of life, which I'm talking about, on cold objects: that it could in fact be very abundant all over the universe, and it's not been detected just because we haven't taken the trouble to look. And then, when you shine sunlight at them, the sunlight will be reflected back, just as it is in the eyes of an animal. And the further out you go in this, away from the Sun, the more powerful this reflection will be. But if you live in a vacuum, if you live on the surface of one of these objects, say, in the Kuiper Belt, this -- an object like Pluto, or one of the smaller objects in the neighborhood of Pluto, and you happened -- if you're living on the surface there, and you get knocked off the surface by a collision, then it doesn't change anything all that much. We can -- as soon as we have a little bit more understanding of genetic engineering, one of the things you can do with your take-it-home, do-it-yourself genetic engineering kit -- (Laughter) -- is to design a creature that can live on a cold satellite, a place like Europa, so we could colonize Europa with our own creatures.","a place called Europa is one of the moons of Jupiter. it's not very likely that there's life on the surface of Europa. we could design a creature that can live on a cold satellite, a place like Europa.","Physicist Freeman Dyson suggests that we start looking for life on the moons of Jupiter and out past Neptune, in the Kuiper belt and the Oort cloud.

252,"So it wasn't just me, there was a whole generation of us. Ubuntu comes out of a philosophy that says, the only way for me to be human is for you to reflect my humanity back at me. I don't really see it, I don't pay attention to it until there's, you know, like a bug that's dead on the window. (Applause) And when my father complained about this situation, where she's taking a seven-year-old boy to teach this birth control, you know, he used to say, ""Oh, you're turning him into -- you're teaching him how to be a woman."" And so this woman emptied out her suitcase and gave all of her clothes to my mother, and to us, and the toys of her kids, who didn't like that very much, but -- (Laughter) -- that was the only time she cried.

253,"And the third problem about the disease model is, in our rush to do something about people in trouble, in our rush to do something about repairing damage, it never occurred to us to develop interventions to make people happier -- positive interventions. This is a life in which you have as much positive emotion as you possibly can, and the skills to amplify it. You don't have positive emotion. And this is indeed the characteristic of what we think of as the good life. Just to sample the kind of interventions that we find have an effect: when we teach people about the pleasant life, how to have more pleasure in your life, one of your assignments is to take the mindfulness skills, the savoring skills, and you're assigned to design a beautiful day. Your assignment, when you're learning the gratitude visit, is to write a 300-word testimonial to that person, call them on the phone in Phoenix, ask if you can visit, don't tell them why. This is really what you're about. And we ask the question as a function of the three different lives, how much life satisfaction do you get? And I never found that; I found the best you could ever do was to get to zero; that they were empty.

258,"And we've had a classic answer for coordination costs, which is, if you want to coordinate the work of a group of people, you start an institution, right? More recently, because the cost of letting groups communicate with each other has fallen through the floor -- and communication costs are one of the big inputs to coordination -- there has been a second answer, which is to put the cooperation into the infrastructure, to design systems that coordinate the output of the group as a by-product of the operating of the system, without regard to institutional models. So, I'm going to start by trying to answer a question that I know each of you will have asked yourself at some point or other, and which the Internet is purpose-built to answer, which is, where can I get a picture of a roller-skating mermaid? You can see here, over at the end, our most prolific photographer has taken around 350 photos, and you can see there's a few people who have taken hundreds of photos. The institutional response is, I can get 75 percent of the value for 10 percent of the hires -- great, that's what I'll do. You can hire those people as employees, you can coordinate their work and you can get some output. The bigger question is, what do you do about the value down here? I've used a lot of examples from Flickr, but there are actually stories about this from all over. So as much as we want the shield laws, the background -- the institution to which they were attached -- is becoming incoherent.

260,"And I think that's what I'd like to talk about today. But any kind of conversation about architecture -- which is, in fact, what you were just talking about, what was going on here, setting up TED, small-scale architecture -- at the present time can't really happen without a conversation about this, the World Trade Center, and what's been going on there, what it means to us. I think that the World Trade Center in, rather an unfortunate way, brought architecture into focus in a way that I don't think people had thought of in a long time, and made it a subject for common conversation. And so now we're going to think about architecture in a very different way, we're going to think about it like this. There it is. And so we got this, or we had a choice of that. Now, I don't know what you think, but I think this is a pretty stupid decision, because what you've done is just made a permanent memorial to destruction by making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever. And that is the wild divergence in how we choose our architects, in trying to decide whether we want architecture from the kind of technocratic solution to everything -- that there is a large, technical answer that can solve all problems, be they social, be they physical, be they chemical -- or something that's more of a romantic solution. Meanwhile, instead of sending someone working drawings, which are those huge sets of blueprints that you've seen your whole life, what the architect can do is send a set of assembly instructions, like you used to get when you were a child, when you bought little models that said, ""Bolt A to B, and C to D."" And so what the builder will get is every single individual part that has been custom manufactured off-site and delivered on a truck to the site, to that builder, and a set of these instruction manuals. It's not to create a technological solution, it's to seduce you into something that you can do, into something that will please you, something that will lift your spirits, something that will make you feel as if are in another world -- such as his Nobu restaurant in New York, which is supposed to take you from the clutter of New York City to the simplicity of Japan and the elegance of Japanese tradition.","the world trade center brought architecture into focus in a way no one had thought of in a long time. aaron carroll: we're going to think about architecture like this, or we had a choice of that. he says it's a wild divergence in how we choose our architects. carroll: architecture is not to create a technocratic solution, it's to seduce you.","Reed Kroloff gives us a new lens for judging new architecture: is it modern, or is it romantic?

263,"In fact, this dark matter dominates the gravitational effects in the universe on a large scale, and I'll be telling you about the evidence for that. As you can imagine, even if you know physics, this should be intuitive, OK -- that stars that are closer to the mass in the middle will be rotating at a higher speed than those that are further out here, OK. And again, what we find is that there is much more mass there than can be accounted for by the galaxies that we see. We say, the ray of light came this way; the galaxy must be there, OK. Now, suppose I put in the middle a cluster of galaxies -- and don't forget the dark matter, OK. Now, if we consider a different ray of light, one going off like this, we now need to take into account what Einstein predicted when he developed general relativity. And now put the lens over the galaxy, and what you'll find is that you'll see a ring, an Einstein ring. So the evidence that we have that a quarter of the universe is dark matter -- this gravitationally attracting stuff -- is that galaxies, the speed with which stars orbiting galaxies is much too large; it must be embedded in dark matter. Now, so at this point, then, what I want to really emphasize to you, is that, first of all, dark matter and dark energy are completely different things, OK. Now, we look for these dark matter particles because, after all, they are here in the room, OK, and they didn't come in the door.

265,"And so, the question is, why aren't we really seeing this kind of power in computers that we see in the brain? Let's just take a look about how the brain works, and then I'll compare that with how computers work. And that's basically what's going on in your brain right now as you're watching this. In the computer, you have all the data going through the central processing unit, and any piece of data basically has to go through that bottleneck, whereas in the brain, what you have is these neurons, and the data just really flows through a network of connections among the neurons. And then the way that you process that data to get a result is that you translate this pattern of activity into a new pattern of activity, just by it flowing through the network. What you see here is that there's these redundant connections. They want to compress the information -- they just want to send the changes, what's new in the image, and so on -- and that is how your eyeball is able to squeeze all that information down to your optic nerve, to send to the rest of the brain. And this is the same thing you see when people compress video to send: they want to make it very sparse, because that file is smaller. And this is what the retina is doing, and it's doing it just with the circuitry, and how this network of neurons that are interacting in there, which we've captured on the chip. So this image here is going to look like these ones, but here I'll show you that we can reconstruct the image, so, you know, you can almost recognize Kareem in that top part there.","in the computer, you have all the data going through the central processing unit. in the brain, what you have is a network of connections among the neurons. this is how your eyeball is able to squeeze all that information down to your optic nerve.","Researcher Kwabena Boahen is looking for ways to mimic the brain's supercomputing powers in silicon -- because the messy, redundant processes inside our heads actually make for a small, light, superfast computer."

But if you haven't played with a battery and a bulb, if you've only seen a circuit diagram, you might not be able to do that, and that's one of the problems.

269,"And I would like to make a case to you that over the years since we first developed atomic weaponry, until this very moment, we've actually lived in a dangerous nuclear world that's characterized by two phases, which I'm going to go through with you right now. But I want to just point out to you that 95 percent of the nuclear weapons at any particular time since 1985 -- going forward, of course -- were part of the arsenals of the United States and the Soviet Union. They could be ""re-commissioned,"" but the way they count things, which is very complicated, we think we have about a third of the nuclear weapons we had before. You -- there would be a nuclear conflagration about to hit us, and if you get under your desk, things would be OK. (Laughter) I didn't do all that well in psychiatry in medical school, but I was interested, and I think this was seriously delusional. Maybe it would be a study when we weren't having an atomic war, or you could use it as a TV room, or, as many teenagers found out, a very, very safe place for a little privacy with your girlfriend. And that's -- I'm just telling you, this is not good. My point now, though, is that there is a lot that we could do for you who are in here, if you've survived the initial blast. And if you do that, you actually can survive a nuclear blast. So here's what you do. You know, if you're out there and you see buildings horribly destroyed and down in that direction, less destroyed here, then you know that it was over there, the blast, and you're going this way, as long as you're going crosswise to the wind.","bob greene: we've lived in a dangerous nuclear world that's characterized by two phases. he says we think we have about a third of the nuclear weapons we had before. greene: if you survive the initial blast, you actually can survive a nuclear blast.","The face of nuclear terror has changed since the Cold War, but disaster-medicine expert Irwin Redlener reminds us the threat is still real.

270,"So in origami, to obey these laws, we can take simple patterns -- like this repeating pattern of folds, called textures -- and by itself it's nothing. But if we follow the laws of origami, we can put these patterns into another fold that itself might be something very, very simple, but when we put it together, we get something a little different. We take an idea, combine it with a square, and you get an origami figure. And then once I have that folded shape that we call the base, you can make the legs narrower, you can bend them, you can turn it into the finished shape. And I'm going to show you all how to do that so you can go out of here and fold something. Well, if I unfold it and go back to the crease pattern, you can see that the upper left corner of that shape is the paper that went into the flap. What if I want to make something that has a lot of flaps? And if you take this crease pattern, you fold on the dotted lines, you'll get a base that you can then shape into a deer, with exactly the crease pattern that you wanted. So now people can say, ""I want exactly this and this and this,"" and you can go out and fold it. It's a very simple pattern -- you wouldn't even call that origami.","bob greene: origami uses simple patterns to make something a little different. greene: you can combine an idea with a square, and you get an origami figure. he says you can bend the legs, bend the legs, turn it into the finished shape. greene: if you follow the laws of origami, you can make something that has a lot of flaps.","Robert Lang is a pioneer of the newest kind of origami -- using math and engineering principles to fold mind-blowingly intricate designs that are beautiful and, sometimes, very useful."

274,"And if you buy all of this, and you think life is about computation, as I do, then you look at big questions through the eyes of a computer scientist. When you look at DNA origami, you can see that what it really is, even though you think it's complicated, is a bunch of double helices that are parallel to each other, and they're held together by places where short strands go along one helix and then jump to another one. What is it? You zoom in, there are just four DNA strands and they have little single-stranded bits on them that can bind to other tiles, if they match. So, what we've done is we've figured out a way to have a molecular program know when to stop going. Here's the DNA origami, and what we can do is we can write 32 on both edges of the DNA origami, and we can now use our watering can and water with tiles, and we can start growing tiles off of that and create a square. If we wanted to make a square of size 10, 100 or 1,000, if we used DNA origami alone, we would require a number of DNA strands that's the square of the size of that square; so we'd need 100, 10,000 or a million DNA strands. But if we use a little computation -- we use origami, plus some tiles that count -- then we can get away with using 100, 200 or 300 DNA strands. If you look at the square that you build with the origami and some counters growing off it, the pattern that it has is exactly the pattern that you need to make a memory. You know, so this is all very cool, but what I'd like you to take from the talk, hopefully from some of those big questions, is that this molecular programming isn't just about making gadgets.","DNA origami is a bunch of double helices that are parallel to each other. scientists have figured out a way to have a molecular program know when to stop. if we wanted to make a square of size 10, 100 or 1,000, if we used DNA origami alone, we would need 100, 10,000 or a million DNA strands.","In 2007, Paul Rothemund gave TED a short summary of his specialty, DNA folding.

Well, all over the Muslim world there are people who take Islam deeply seriously, people who care about Islam, for whom it's a source either of faith, or of civilization, or of deep values, or just a source of powerful personal identity, who think and are saying loudly that Islam and democracy are in fact not in conflict, but are in fact deeply compatible. But now that the Cold War is over, there's nearly universal consensus in the Muslim world -- and pretty close to the same here in the United States, if you talk to people and ask them -- that in principle, there's no reason that democracy and Islam cannot co-exist. Now what I want to suggest to you is that the reason for hope in this case is that we are on the edge of a real transformation in the Muslim world. It will also not look exactly the way either the people in this room, or Muslims out in the rest of the world -- I don't mean to imply there aren't Muslims here, there probably are -- conceptualize Islam. Now, I began with the war because it's the elephant in the room, and you can't pretend that there isn't about to be a war if you're talking about these issues. The war has tremendous risks for the model that I'm describing because it's very possible that as a consequence of a war, many Muslims will conclude that the United States is not the kind of place that they want to emulate with respect to its forms of political government. On the other hand, the capacities for positive results in the aftermath of a war are also not to be underestimated, even by, and I would say especially by, people who are deeply skeptical about whether we should go to war in the first place.","aaron miller: fear is not an implausible reaction with a war just around the corner. miller: there's nearly universal consensus in the Muslim world that democracy and Islam can co-exist. he says we are on the edge of a real transformation in the Muslim world. miller: we need a new way of thinking about the world, not a new way of thinking about it.","Noah Feldman makes a searing case that both politics and religion -- whatever their differences -- are similar technologies, designed to efficiently connect and manage any group of people."

I get up at 4 a.m. every day and go cook the food for the kids, because this is what we need to do. You know, we have to change it. You know, the things that we maybe do at home and think are so important, we have to teach kids about in school. You know, if you have kids coming into lunch and all they're going to do when they get out of lunch is go to have recess, you see them just throw away their lunch so they can run outside. I think if we're going to fix this, one of the things we have to do is really change how we have oversight over the National School Lunch Program. That means we spend less than a dollar a day on food for kids in schools -- most schools, 80 to 90 cents. In our country, it's the kids that need it the most, who get this really, really lousy food.","we spend less than a dollar a day on food for kids in schools. bob greene: we have to change how we have oversight over the national school lunch program. he says kids that need it the most get this really, really lousy food. greene: we have to change how we have oversight over the National School Lunch Program.","Speaking at the 2007 EG conference, ""renegade lunch lady"" Ann Cooper talks about the coming revolution in the way kids eat at school -- local, sustainable, seasonal and even educational food."
289,"A year ago, I spoke to you about a book that I was just in the process of completing, that has come out in the interim, and I would like to talk to you today about some of the controversies that that book inspired. There are a number of reasons to doubt that the human mind is a blank slate, and some of them just come from common sense. There are also, I think, increasing results from the scientific study of humans that, indeed, we're not born blank slates. They are: the arts and parenting. Well, in fact, the arts are not in decline. And here's just one example. Well, the argument in ""The Blank Slate"" was that elite art and criticism in the 20th century, although not the arts in general, have disdained beauty, pleasure, clarity, insight and style. They're useless because they don't control for heritability. You might think, well, then they'd be even more similar, because not only would they share their genes, but they would also share their environment. What it suggests is that children are shaped not by their parents over the long run, but in part -- only in part -- by their genes, in part by their culture -- the culture of the country at large and the children's own culture, namely their peer group -- as we heard from Jill Sobule earlier today, that's what kids care about -- and, to a very large extent, larger than most people are prepared to acknowledge, by chance: chance events in the wiring of the brain in utero; chance events as you live your life.","jeffrey toobin: there are controversies about whether the human mind is a blank slate. toobin: science shows we're not born blank slates, but the arts are not in decline. toobin: kids are shaped not by their parents over the long run, but by their genes. toobin: kids are shaped by their peer group, not by their parents over the long run.","Steven Pinker's book The Blank Slate argues that all humans are born with some innate traits.

So, all the waters of the world are served there, so we thought that, you know, after being at the water and moving through the water and breathing the water, you could also drink this building. In 2003, the Whitney mounted a retrospective of our work that featured a lot of this work from the '80s and '90s. We used the wall to partition the 13 installations of the project and produce a kind of acoustic and visual separation. So, you come in and you're basically squeezed by the theater, by the belly of the theater, into this very compressed space where the view is turned off. And this was really a kind of very important part of this building, and here is a point where architecture -- this is like technology-free -- architecture is only a framing device, it only edits the harbor view, the industrial harbor just through its walls, its floors and its ceiling, to only expose the water itself, the texture of water, much like a hypnotic effect created by electronic snow or a lava lamp or something like that.

303,"So why didn't the Greenland Norse as well? And then finally, the fifth item on my checklist is the political, economic, social and cultural factors in the society that make it more or less likely that the society will perceive and solve its environmental problems. In the case of the Greenland Norse, cultural factors that made it difficult for them to solve their problems were: their commitments to a Christian society investing heavily in cathedrals; their being a competitive-ranked chiefly society; and their scorn for the Inuit, from whom they refused to learn. So, I'm looking at these issues of collapses for a lot of past societies and for many present societies. There are many societies that don't wind down gradually, but they build up -- get richer and more powerful -- and then within a short time, within a few decades after their peak, they collapse. A second general theme is that there are many, often subtle environmental factors that make some societies more fragile than others.

304,"I love doing this work, because it really gives many people new hope and new choices that they didn't have before, and it allows us to talk about things that -- not just diet, but that happiness is not -- we're talking about the pursuit of happiness, but when you really look at all the spiritual traditions, what Aldous Huxley called the ""perennial wisdom,"" when you get past the names and forms and rituals that divide people, it's really about -- our nature is to be happy; our nature is to be peaceful, our nature is to be healthy. And so happiness is not something you get, health is generally not something that you get, but rather, all of these different practices -- you know, the ancient swamis and rabbis and priests and monks and nuns didn't develop these techniques to just manage stress or lower your blood pressure or unclog your arteries, even though it can do all those things. And it's not a diet. When I began doing this work 26 or 27 years ago, it was thought that once you have heart disease, it can only get worse. But it's really not natural; we found it could get better and better, and much more quickly than people thought. We also found the more people changed, the better they got. And what we found was that 99 percent of the patients stopped or reversed the progression of their heart disease. And the paradox is that when you make big changes, you get big benefits, and you feel so much better so quickly. The problem is, it's based on this half-truth: Americans eat too many simple carbs, so if you eat fewer, you'll lose weight, and even more weight if you eat whole foods and less fat, and you'll enhance your health rather than harming it. The last thing I want to talk about, apropos of the issue of the pursuit of happiness, is that study after study has shown that people who are lonely and depressed -- and depression is the other real epidemic in our culture -- are many times more likely to get sick and die prematurely, in part because, as we talked about, they're more likely to smoke, overeat, drink too much, work too hard, and so on.","dean obeidallah: we're talking about the pursuit of happiness, but it's not a diet. obeidallah: when you make big changes, you get big benefits, and you feel so much better. he says people who are lonely and depressed are more likely to get sick and die prematurely. obeidallah: if you're depressed, you're more likely to smoke, drink too much, work too hard.","Dean Ornish talks about simple, low-tech and low-cost ways to take advantage of the body's natural desire to heal itself."

This seems weird to us, because each of us only experiences an individual existence, and we don't get to see other branches. The charges of all known particles can be plotted in a four-dimensional charge space, and projected down to two dimensions like this so we can see them. So there's an old idea in particle physics that this known pattern of charges, which is not very symmetric, could emerge from a more perfect pattern that gets broken -- similar to how the Higgs particle breaks the electroweak pattern to give electromagnetism. It's a very beautiful object, and as with any unification, we can see some holes where new particles are required by this pattern. From their location in this pattern, we know that these new particles should be scalar fields like the Higgs particle, but have color charge and interact with the strong force. (Laughter) Now, how bad would that be? GL: Well, right now the pattern I showed you that corresponds to what we know about elementary particle physics -- that already corresponds to a very beautiful shape. And that would be what explains all these elementary particles that we see. And -- in this way, the way that E8 comes in is it will be as a shape that's attached at each point in the space-time.",the charges of all known particles can be plotted in a four-dimensional charge space. we can see holes where new particles are required by this pattern. the pattern corresponds to what we know about elementary particle physics.,"Physicist and surfer Garrett Lisi presents a controversial new model of the universe that -- just maybe -- answers all the big questions.

312,"Really good designers are like sponges: they really are curious and absorb every kind of information that comes their way, and transform it so that it can be used by people like us. We all know it, and we do it kind of automatically. And this exhibition is about the work of designers that help us be more elastic, and also of designers that really work on this elasticity as an opportunity. And one last thing is that it's not only designers, but it's also scientists. The exhibition will talk about the work of both designers and scientists, and show how they're presenting the possibilities of the future to us. This is the work of design students from the Royal College of Arts in London that have been working together with their tutor, Tony Dunne, and with a bunch of scientists around Great Britain on the possibilities of nanotechnology for design in the future. So you go, even in the exhibition, from the idea of nanotechnology and the nanoscale to the manipulation of really great amounts of data -- the mapping and tagging of the universe and of the world. Another aspect of contemporary design that I think is mind-opening, promising and will really be the future of design, is the idea of collective design. This is quite beautiful. And many designers have been working recently on the idea of death and mourning, and what we can do about it today with new technologies.","the exhibition is about the work of designers that help us be more elastic. it's not only designers, but it's also scientists who are presenting the possibilities of the future to us. the idea of collective design is mind-opening, promising and will be the future of design.",MOMA design curator Paola Antonelli previews the groundbreaking show Design and the Elastic Mind -- full of products and designs that reflect the way we think now.
313,"But I found that on the -- I read in the newspapers that there was to be a presentation by someone in a place that I'd seen in the center of Zurich, and it was about flying saucers [that] he was going to talk. And it's interesting, if you think about it, how, when we think about the civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement -- whether it's China, Greece, the Hindu civilization, or the Mayas, or Egyptians -- what we know about them is really about their ecstasies, not about their everyday life. Now, this man doesn't need to go to a place like this, which is also -- this place, this arena, which is built like a Greek amphitheatre, is a place for ecstasy also. We are participating in a reality that is different from that of the everyday life that we're used to. You can't understand more than two people talking to you.

And two things that we measure is the amount of challenge people experience at that moment and the amount of skill that they feel they have at that moment. And you may be doing things very differently from other people, but for everyone that flow channel, that area there, will be when you are doing what you really like to do -- play the piano, be with your best friend, perhaps work, if work is what provides flow for you.

And because he was so sad and so vulnerable, he opened up to me in ways he never would have had I known him at the height of his power -- sharing his fears, his sorrows and his worries. It was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large that even the love of a family, without work, could not fill it. they said.

In the presence of God, there is no room for more than one ""I,"" and that is the ""I"" of divinity. You want your employees to do what you ask them to do, and if they've done that, then they can do extra. It is this merging of our self with divinity that is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions. That is a moment which is a gift of God to us -- a gift when, for a moment, he lifts that boundary which makes us insist on ""I, I, I, me, me, me,"" and instead, like the person in Rumi's story, we say, ""Oh, this is all you.

The first science of cosmology that was anything like science was Aristotelian science, and that was hierarchical. Now, in the 17th century there was a revolution in thinking about space and time and motion and so forth of Newton. Now, similarly, in Lockeâ€™s society there are individuals who have certain rights, properties in a formal sense, and those are defined with respect to some absolute, abstract notions of rights and justice, and so forth, which are independent of what else has happened in the society. There is also an omniscient observer who knows everything, who is God, who is in a certain sense outside the universe, because he has no role in anything that happens, but is in a certain sense everywhere, because space is just the way that God knows where everything is, according to Newton, OK? And merging them together to make the final quantum theory of space and time and gravity, is the culmination of that, something thatâ€™s going on right now. All properties of things are about these kinds of relationships. Because thereâ€™s no place to put a maker outside, as there was in the Aristotelian and the Newtonian universe. And what weâ€™ve been working out is the implications, really, of the idea that the universe is made up of relations.","the first science of cosmology that was anything like science was Aristotelian science. in the 17th century there was a revolution in thinking about space and time and motion. there is also an omniscient observer who knows everything, who is God.","Physicist Lee Smolin talks about how the scientific community works: as he puts it, ""we fight and argue as hard as we can,"" but everyone accepts that the next generation of scientists will decide who's right.

And I learned in that class -- because I would do things like this ... and they were all gathered around, going, ""What's he trying to say?"" My dad came out to see me graduate and, you know, I did the deal, and my father said, ""Weâ€™re really proud of you son, but ... "" You know what went on, he said, ""Youâ€™ve got to start riding and driving and start talking. And itâ€™s one of those things that came out of the silence, the listening to each other. And so thatâ€™s the message that I had. I had no idea I would have a Ph.D. And so I realized that I had a responsibility to more than just me, and that I was going to have to change.","when i was 27, i used to listen just enough to hear what people had to say. i had no idea i would have a Ph.D. and realized that i had a responsibility to more than just me.","For almost three decades, John Francis has been a planetwalker, traveling the globe by foot and sail with a message of environmental respect and responsibility (for 17 of those years without speaking).

326,"Aimee Corrigan, a very talented and young photographer, and Robert Caputo, a friend and a mentor, who is a veteran of National Geographic, and told me, ""You know, Franco, in 25 years of covering Africa, I don't know if I have come across a story that is so full of hope and so fun."" The plan was to give you a portrait of Nollywood, of this incredible film industry, following Bond in his quest to make an action movie that deals with the issue of corruption, called ""Checkpoint."" I mean, there are those films that people are making for quality, but the first thing you have to remember about this society is that Africa still has people that live on one dollar a day, and these are the people that really watch these films. Itâ€™s not just what you see in picture. Itâ€™s not just what you see in the picture. For a young man to really make it out here, you got to think of some negative things and all that, or some kind of vices. The Nigerian filmmakers really, really, are doing what they like. Iâ€™m very interested in it and I really think that the digital non-linear editing has slashed, you know, the cost now is a fraction of what it used to be. Filmmakers, friends of mine, they look at Nollywood and they say, ""Wow, they are doing what we really want to do, and make a buck and live with this job."" So this is what I really think.","african filmmakers are doing what they like, says photographer aimee corrigan. digital non-linear editing has slashed the cost of filmmaking, she says.

327,"And that's what that moment with Patricia Schroeder I think shows: that if we are to bring about an end to the world's worst atrocities, we have to make it such. It sees itself, such as it is, the it, as something that will create the impression that there will be political cost, there will be a political price to be paid, for allowing genocide, for not having an heroic imagination, for not being an upstander but for being, in fact, a bystander. They have a 1-800-GENOCIDE number -- this is going to sound very kitsch, but for those of you who may not be, I mean, may be apolitical, but interested in doing something about genocide, you dial 1-800-GENOCIDE and you type in your zip code, and you don't even have to know who your congressperson is. And the students and the others who are part of this incredibly energized base are there to answer that, and there's always something to do. Now, what this movement has done is it has extracted from the Bush administration from the United States, at a time of massive over-stretch -- military, financial, diplomatic -- a whole series of commitments to Darfur that no other country in the world is making. I think there are a couple -- there are many reasons -- but a couple just to focus on briefly. So this movement, if it's to be durable and global, will have to cross borders, and you will have to see other citizens in democracies, not simply resting on the assumption that their government would do something in the face of genocide, but actually making it such. What do you do? If we think about dignity in our conduct as citizens and as individuals with relation to the people around us, and as a country, if we could inject a regard for dignity into our dealings with other countries, it would be something of a revolution. And the lesson, I think, of the anti-genocide movement that I mentioned, that is a partial success but by no means has it achieved what it has set out to do -- it'll be many decades, probably, before that happens -- but is that if we want to see change, we have to become the change.","john avlon: if we want to end genocide, we have to make it such. avlon: if we want to see change, we have to become the change. avlon: if we want to see change, we have to become the change.","Would you negotiate with someone you knew to be evil, to save lives?

328,"In about two minutes, it had reached the level of the railroad tracks and was coming over it. We don't think another wave is coming right away. In the world of blogs, there's going to be before the tsunami and after the tsunami, because one of the things that happened in the wake of the tsunami was that, although initially -- that is, in that first day -- there was actually a kind of dearth of live reporting, there was a dearth of live video and some people complained about this. What became very clear was that, within a few days, the outpouring of information was immense, and we got a complete and powerful picture of what had happened in a way that we never had been able to get before. And what you had was a group of essentially unorganized, unconnected writers, video bloggers, etc., who were able to come up with a collective portrait of a disaster that gave us a much better sense of what it was like to actually be there than the mainstream media could give us. You know, if you think about something like Google, which essentially is relying on the collective intelligence of the Web to seek out those sites that have the most valuable information -- we know that Google does an exceptionally good job of doing that, and it does that because, collectively, this disorganized thing we call the ""World Wide Web"" actually has a remarkable order, or a remarkable intelligence in it. But what the blogosphere offers is the possibility of getting at the kind of collective, distributive intelligence that is out there, and that we know is available to us if we can just figure out a way of accessing it. It is very easy to think that networks are necessarily good things -- that being linked from one place to another, that being tightly linked in a group, is a very good thing. So, one of the phenomena that's very clear in the blogosphere is that once a meme, once an idea gets going, it is very easy for people to just sort of pile on, because other people have, say, a link. Now, I want to connect this back, though, to the tsunami, because one of the great things about the tsunami -- in terms of the blogosphere's coverage, not in terms of the tsunami itself -- is that it really did represent a genuine bottom-up phenomenon.",bob greene: the blogosphere gave us a powerful picture of what happened in the tsunami. he says it's easy to think that networks are necessarily good things. he says the tsunami was a genuine bottom-up phenomenon. greene: the blogosphere is a great way to get at distributive intelligence.,"James Surowiecki pinpoints the moment when social media became an equal player in the world of news-gathering: the 2005 tsunami, when YouTube video, blogs, IMs and txts carried the news -- and preserved moving personal stories from the tragedy."

334,"The fact is, when we do our market research around the world, we see there's a nearly universal aspiration on the part of people to own an automobile -- 750 million people in the world today own a car. We really have to ask the question: Can the world sustain that number of automobiles? A lot of hydrogen is produced today in the world. What we've targeted for ourselves -- and we're making great progress toward this goal -- is to have a propulsion system based on hydrogen and fuel cells, designed and validated, that can go head-to-head with the internal combustion engine.

That is to say, at that time it was believed that there was nothing up there except the branches of Redwood trees. There they are. And then it bursts into a forest of Redwoods. But as you go and you look closer at a tree, what you see is, you see increasing complexity. One of the things that is just -- I almost can't conceive it -- is the idea that the national news media hasn't picked this up at all, and this is the devastation of one of the most important ecosystems in North America. But we're different from trees, and they can also teach us something about ourselves in the differences that we have. (Applause) Chris Anderson: I think at a previous TED, I think it was Nathan Myhrvold who told me that it was thought that because these trees are like, 2,000 years and older, on many of them there are ecosystems where there are species that are not found anywhere on the Earth except on that one tree.

339,"And so for me, I know that when the Internet came around and I was doing computer programming and just, you know, just generally trying to run my own little company and figure out what to do with the Internet and with computers, I was just immediately struck by how the ultimate thing that you would really want to do with the Internet and with computers would be to use the Internet and connected computers to simulate a world to sort of recreate the laws of physics and the rules of how things went together -- the sort of -- the idea of atoms and how to make things, and do that inside a computer so that we could all get in there and make stuff. And in fact, it's going to be so different than what we see here on earth that anything is going to be possible. You know, to give you a size idea about scale, you know, comparing space to Second Life, most people don't realize, kind of -- and then this is just like the Internet in the early '90s.

That's one way of organizing information, but there are two things about the way you access information in a virtual world that I think are the important ways that they're very different and much better than what we've been able to do to date with the Web. When you're on Amazon.com and you're looking for digital cameras or whatever, you're on there right now, when you're on the site, with like 5,000 other people, but you can't talk to them. And so I think, again, that it's likely that in the next decade or so these virtual worlds are going to be the most common way as human beings that we kind of use the electronics of the Internet, if you will, to be together, to consume information. You have to have that level of freedom, and so I'm often asked that, you know, is there a, kind of, utopian or, is there a utopian tendency to Second Life and things like it, that you would create a world that has a grand scheme to it? And what was so amazing right from the start was that the idea that we had put out in the zoning concept, basically, was instantly and thoroughly ignored, and like, two months into the whole thing, -- which is really a small amount of time, even in Second Life time -- I remember the users, the people who were then using Second Life, the residents came to me and said, we want to buy the disco -- because I had built it -- we want to buy that land and raze it and put houses on it. So, that's it.","in the next decade or so, virtual worlds are going to be the most common way to consume information. virtual worlds are going to be the most common way as human beings that we use the electronics of the Internet. the idea that we had put out in the zoning concept was instantly and thoroughly ignored.","Why build a virtual world?

But what is new is that, when we rotate this disc about this axis, this disc of light actually becomes a sphere of light. And so we can control that with micro-controllers and create a fully volumetric, three-dimensional display with just 256 LEDs.

Same thing: he understood the shape of the future, even though it was something that would only be implemented by people much later. I think these are the four principles that go into this. Also, another sense which comics' vision represents, and that's time. So I wrote a book about this in '93, but as I was finishing the book, I had to do a little bit of typesetting, and I was tired of going to my local copy shop to do it, so I bought a computer. The problem was that if you go with this basic idea that space equals time in comics, what happens is that when you introduce sound and motion, which are temporal phenomena that can only be represented through time, they break with that continuity of presentation. Each of them has a single unbroken reading line, whether it's going zigzag across the walls or spiraling up a column or just straight left to right, or even going in a backwards zigzag across those 88 accordion-folded pages, the same thing is happening; that is, that the basic idea that as you move through space you move through time, is being carried out without any compromise, but there were compromises when print hit. This was back in the late '90s, and other people in my business thought I was pretty crazy, but a lot of people then went on and actually did it.

356,"And I used three criteria: the first was, I thought I'd talk about real design within reach, design that's free, not design not quite within reach, as we're fondly known by our competition and competitors, but stuff that you can find on the streets, stuff that was free, stuff that was available to all people, and stuff that probably contains some other important messages. And I had a bit of a wake-up call in Amsterdam: I was there going into the design stores, and mixing with our crowd of designers, and I recognized that a whole lot of stuff pretty much looked the same, and the effect of globalization has had that in our community also. I was walking around on the streets of Amsterdam and I recognized, you know, the big story from Amsterdam isn't what's in the design stores, it's what's out on the streets, and maybe it's self-explanatory, but a city that hasn't been taken over by modernism, that's preserved its kind of architecture and character, and where the bicycle plays an important part of the way in which people get around and where pedestrian rights are protected. I then kind of thought about the other cities in Europe where I spend a lot of time looking for design, like Basel, where Vitra is located, or in northern Italy -- all cities where there are a whole lot of bicycles, and where pedestrian areas -- and I came to the conclusion that perhaps there was something about these important design centers that dealt with bicycles and foot traffic, and I'm sure the skeptic eye would say, no, the correlation there is that there are universities and schools where people can't afford cars, but it did seem that in many of these areas pedestrian traffic was protected. And I realized that, you know, Italy is a place where they can accept these different ideologies and deal with diversity and not have the problem, or they can choose to ignore them, but these -- you don't have warring factions, and I think that maybe the tolerance of the absurdity which has made Italy so innovative   and so tolerant. And as I look at it, I sort of say, you know, the publications that report on problems in the urban area also contribute to it, and it's just my call to say to all of us, public policy won't change this at all; private industry has to work to take things like this seriously. Now, this is not going to impress you guys who Photoshop, and can do stuff,  but this was an actual moment when I got off my bike, and I looked and I thought, it's as if all of my biker brethren had kind of gotten together and conspired to make a little statement. And I do think pattern has the capability of eradicating some of the most evil forces of society, such as bad form in restaurants, but quite seriously, it was a statement to me that one thing that you do, sort of, see is the aggressive nature of the industrial world has produced -- kind of, large masses of things, and when you -- in monoculture, and I think the preservation of diversity in culture is something that's important to us. The U.S. is actually becoming a bit of a leader in kind of enlightened urban planning and renewal, and I want to single out a place like Chicago, where I look at some guy like Mayor Daley as a bit of a design hero for being able to work through the political processes and all that to improve an area. And it's a welcoming area, I think, inclusive of diversity, reflective of diversity, and I think this marriage of both technology and art in the public sector is an area where the U.S. can really take a leadership role, and Chicago is one example.","cnn's john sutter says he had a bit of a wake-up call in Amsterdam. he says the big story from Amsterdam isn't what's in the design stores, it's what's out on the streets. sutter: public policy won't change this at all.","Rob Forbes, the founder of Design Within Reach, shows a gallery of snapshots that inform his way of seeing the world.

358,"A genome is really a description for  all of the DNA that is in a living organism. In fact, many, many diseases we have struggled with for a long time, like cancer, we haven't been able to cure because we just don't understand how it works at the genomic level. So, up to this point we tried to fix it by using what I call shit-against-the-wall pharmacology, which means, well, let's just throw chemicals at it, and maybe it's going to make it work. And if you think about the computer industry and how we've gone from big computers to little ones and how they get more powerful and faster all the time, the same thing is happening with gene sequencing now: we are on the cusp of being able to sequence human genomes for about 5,000 dollars in about an hour or a half-hour; you will see that happen in the next five years. You will give your genome to the pharmacist, and your drug will be made for you and it will work much better than the ones that were -- you won't have side effects. If you saw the genome for a mouse or for a human it would look no different than this, but what scientists are doing now is they're understanding what these do and what they mean.

359,"Well, I'm really excited to talk a bit about my own upbringing in music and family and all of that, but I'm even more excited for you people to hear about Donnell's amazing family and maybe even a little bit about how we met, and all that sort of thing, but for those of you that may not be familiar with my upbringing, I'm from Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, eastern Canada, which is a very, very musical island, and its origins come from Scotland with the music and all the traditions, the dancing, the language, which unfortunately is dying out in Cape Breton. Well, cÃ¨ilidh first of all is Gaelic for party, but kitchen party in Cape Breton is very common, and basically somebody drops into the house, and no matter what house you go to in Cape Breton, there's a fiddle there, guaranteed, and I'd say, well there's first of all more fiddlers per capita in Cape Breton than anywhere in the world, so ten chances to one, the fellow who walked in the door could play it, so you'd have someone come into the house, you'd invite them to play a tune, and lo and behold a little party would start up and somebody would dance, and somebody would sing, and all that sort of thing, so it was a wonderful, wonderful way to grow up, and that is where my beginnings in music come from: my surroundings, my family, just my bloodline in itself, and, oh, I've done lots of things with my music. I was nominated for a Grammy and I've won some awards and stuff like that, so that's awesome, but the best part was meeting my husband, and I've actually known Donnell for probably 12 years now, and I'm going to get into a little bit of, I guess, how music brought us together, but I'm going to introduce you right now to my new husband as of October 5, Donnell Leahy. Years ago, hundreds of men would go up for the winter to the camps in Northern Ontario and in Quebec, and they were all different cultures, and the Irish, the French, Scottish, German, they'd all meet, and of course at night, they'd play cards and step dance and play fiddles, and over the course of many years, the Ottawa Valley fiddling kind of evolved and the Ottawa Valley step dancing evolved, so that's, I kind of started out with that style and I quickly started doing my own thing, and then I met Natalie, and I was exposed to the great Cape Breton fiddling. Well, it's just so interesting that Donnell's upbringing was very similar to mine, and I actually saw Donnell play when I was about 12 years old, and he and his family came to Inverness, which is about 45 minutes from where I lived, and I was just blown away, like, it was just amazing, and you'll find out why pretty soon here, but I couldn't believe the fiddling and Mom was there with me, and she was saying â€” Donnell's mother came up on stage and danced with her children, and Mom was saying, ""That's Julie MacDonnell, I used to dance with her when we were kids. (Laughter) (Applause) DL: So anyway, we're running out of time, so I'll just get to it. I'm going to play a piece of music for you. I'll quickly play a short part of the air, and then I'm going to get into kind of a crazy tune that is very difficult to play when you're not warmed up, so, if I mess it up, pretend you like it anyway. Before Mom's family had a piano in Cape Breton, she learned to play the rhythms on a piece of board, and the fiddlers would all congregate to play on the cold winter's evenings and Mom would be banging on this board, so when they bought a piano, they bought it in Toronto and had it taken by train and brought in on a horse, a horse and sleigh to the house. (Applause) (Laughter) DL: Oh yeah, okay, in my family we had seven girls, four boys, we had two fiddles and one piano, and of course we were all fighting to play on the instruments, so dad and mom set a rule that you couldn't kick anyone off the instrument.","Donnell Leahy is from Cape Breton Island, a very musical island. he's known Donnell for probably 12 years, and he's now married. he says he's a great musician, but he's also a great songwriter.","Natalie MacMaster and her musical partner Donnell Leahy play several tunes from the Cape Breton tradition -- a sprightly, soulful style of folk fiddling. It's an inspired collaboration that will have you clapping (and maybe dancing) along."
360,"Well, Don Brownlee, my friend, and I finally got to the point where we got tired of turning on the TV and seeing the spaceships and seeing the aliens every night, and tried to write a counter-argument to it, and put out what does it really take for an Earth to be habitable, for a planet to be an Earth, to have a place where you could probably get not just life, but complexity, which requires a huge amount of evolution, and therefore constancy of conditions. It was, ""It burns! And I really do think we have to start thinking about what's a good planet and what isn't. Now, I throw this slide up because it indicates to me that, even if SETI does hear something, can we figure out what they said? Because this was a slide that was passed between the two major intelligences on Earth -- a Mac to a PC -- and it can't even get the letters right -- (Laughter) -- so how are we going to talk to the aliens? And that will happen, paradoxically -- everything you hear about global warming -- when we hit CO2 down to 10 parts per million, we are no longer going to have to have plants that are allowed to have any photosynthesis, and there go animals. The effects of it spread this very thin impact layer all over the planet, and we had very quickly the death of the dinosaurs, the death of these beautiful ammonites, Leconteiceras here, and Celaeceras over here, and so much else. And the what, I think, is that we returned, over and over again, to the Pre-Cambrian world, that first microbial age, and the microbes are still out there.

What are you going to do?","don brownlee: i think we have to start thinking about what's a good planet and what isn't. he says if we hit CO2 down to 10 parts per million, we are no longer going to have plants. brownlee: we return to the Pre-Cambrian world, that first microbial age.","Asteroid strikes get all the coverage, but ""Medea Hypothesis"" author Peter Ward argues that most of Earth's mass extinctions were caused by lowly bacteria.

362,"They like to eat healthy and healthily, but when we think of something as a health food, we think of it as something we eat out of obligation, not out of passion and love for the flavor. We're going to try this at lunch, and I'll explain a bit more about it, but it's made not only with two types of pre-doughs -- this attempt, again, at bringing out flavor is to make a piece of dough the day before that is not leavened. And it's made -- it can be a sourdough starter, or what we call a ""biga"" or any other kind of pre-fermented dough with a little yeast in it, and that starts to develop flavor also. And we're hoping that, sort of, the enzyme piece of dough becomes the fuel pack for the leavened piece of dough, and when we put them together and add the final ingredients, we can create a bread that does evoke the full potential of flavor trapped in the grain. And somehow, this is transformed -- the yeast burps and sweats are later transformed -- and this is really getting to the heart of what makes bread so special is that it is a transformational food, and we're going to explore that in a minute. And at stage nine we get the dough to the final shape, and it goes into the oven -- stage 10. In stage two, we add water and salt to it, mix it together, and we create something that we call ""clay."" But dough is what we're working with, and we take that dough to the oven, and it goes into the oven. And it's what comes out of the oven that is what we call the staff of life. And what we're going to attempt to do with this bread here, again, is to use, in addition to everything we talked about, this bread we're going to call ""spent grain bread"" because, as you know, bread-making is very similar to beer-making.","""spent grain bread"" is a bread made with two types of pre-dough. it's made with a sourdough starter that is not leavened. bread-making is very similar to beer-making.","Batch to batch, crust to crust ...

363,"(Laughter) But of course what we have to remember is this. So what I'm going to try to do in the next 17 and a half minutes is I'm going to talk first about the flames -- where we are in the economy -- and then I'm going to take three trends that have taken place at TED over the last 25 years and that will take place in this conference and I will try and bring them together. And as you think about that, you've got to wonder: so what do banks have in store for you now? And then by 2007 it was 68 percent. And the reason we have to do that in the short term is because we have just run out of cash. (Laughter) Here's what happens if you don't address this stuff. And what's really important in this stuff is, as we cut, we also have to grow. And as you bring these trends together, and as you think of what it means to take people who are profoundly deaf, who can now begin to hear -- I mean, remember the evolution of hearing aids, right? (Laughter) I think what we're going to see is we're going to see a different species of hominid.

364,"And the second thing I learned was that I knew, with profound certainty, that this is exactly what I was going to do for the rest of my life. The limitation of diving with air is all those dots in your body, all the nitrogen and all the oxygen. But if we want to go deeper, of course, we need another gas supply, and helium is what we really need to go deep. We also have a second oxygen cylinder, solely as a backup; if there's a problem with our first oxygen supply, we can continue to breathe. I'm going to take you on a deep dive, and show you what it's like to do one. (Laughter) So we're down there -- this is at 400 feet. And if you're a biologist and know about sharks, and you want to assess, how much jeopardy am I really in here, there's one question that sort of jumps to the forefront of your mind immediately, which is -- (Video) Diver 1: What kind of sharks? When we first found it, we weren't even sure what family it belonged to, so we just called it the Dr. Seuss fish, since it looked like something from one of those books. What's extraordinary is not just the number of species we're finding -- though as you can see, that's pretty amazing; this is only half of what we've found -- what's extraordinary is how quickly we find them. The reason I show this -- not to put a downer on everything -- but I just want to use it to key off my philosophy of life in general, which is that we all have two goals.","diving with air is a limitation, but if we want to go deeper, we need another gas supply. we also have a second oxygen cylinder, solely as a backup. diving with helium is the best way to go deep, says dr. seuss.","In this illuminating talk, Richard Pyle shows us thriving life on the cliffs of coral reefs and groundbreaking diving technologies he has pioneered to explore it.

365,"And David and I discovered that we had a question in common, that we really wanted the answer to, and that was, ""Why hasn't anybody built any computer games for little girls?"" So David and I decided to go find out, through the best research we could muster, what it would take to get a little girl to put her hands on a computer, to achieve the level of comfort and ease with the technology that little boys have because they play video games. They taught me how to look and see, and they did not do the incredibly stupid thing of saying to a child, ""Of all these things we already make you, which do you like best?"" After we had done that with a pretty large team of people and discovered what we thought the salient issues were with girls and boys and playing -- because, after all, that's really what this is about -- we moved to the second phase of our work, where we interviewed adult experts in academia, some of the people who'd produced the literature that we found relevant. We launched two titles in October -- ""Rockett's New School"" -- the first of a series of products -- is about a character called Rockett beginning her first day of school in eighth grade at a brand new place, with a blank slate, which allows girls to play with the question of, ""What will I be like when I'm older?"" I want to talk about the other, because the politics of this enterprise, in a way, have been the most fascinating part of it, for me. These are pictures the girls themselves never saw, but they gave to us This is the stuff those reviewers don't know about and aren't listening to and this is the kind of research I recommend to those who want to do humanistic work.

366,"I'm going to play it for you in a couple minutes,   but I want to make an analogy before I do  to this.

(Applause) Because I have some limited time, I'll cut it off for a second, and tell you about how it works and what it's good for. And, you know, if the sound isn't there, the sale typically isn't made. But what's great about it, from the tests that have been done, is, if you don't want to hear it, you take about one step to the side and you don't hear it. And the sound that you're hearing, unlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is made on the face, is made out in front of it, in the air. So, again, this idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want to is really starting to catch on. We put it on a turret with a camera, so that when they shoot at you, you're over there, and it's there. I usually figure out what my talk is when I get up in front of a group.","bob greene: after 80 years of having sound, it's about time that we figure out a way to put sound where you want to. he says we put it on a turret with a camera so that when they shoot at you, it's there. greene: if you don't want to hear it, you take about one step to the side and you don't hear it.","Woody Norris shows off two of his inventions that use sound in new ways, including the Long Range Acoustic Device, or LRAD.

We need to learn everything we can about it and do everything we can to take care of it. Yet we have this idea, we humans, that the Earth -- all of it: the oceans, the skies -- are so vast and so resilient it doesn't matter what we do to it. Since then, I've had the great pleasure of working with the Googlers, with DOER Marine, with National Geographic, with dozens of the best institutions and scientists around the world, ones that we could enlist, to put the ocean in Google Earth. All of these parts are part of our life support system. This is the consequence of not knowing that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea. There are still some blue whales. Imagine what that means to our life support system. The good news is that there are now more than 4,000 places in the sea, around the world, that have some kind of protection.

If you can drop this recipe on the map on a sandy soil, on a clay soil, on a steep slope, on flat soil, you put those different recipes; if you combine them, out of that comes a business plan, comes a work plan, and you can optimize it for the amount of labor you have available or for the amount of fertilizer you have, and you can do it. So you have to do it with the local people. It's not that simple, and you have to work with the people.

And then I did some variations of it, but it still wasn't coalescing graphically at all. (Laughter) So here's what it says in my explanation at the bottom left. One is the sort of willingness to expose myself to a critical audience, and not to suggest that I am confident about what I'm doing. And as you know, you have to have a front.

375,"For many millennia, humans have been on a journey to find answers, answers to questions about naturalism and transcendence, about who we are and why we are, and of course, who else might be out there. (Laughter) But, what if we're not? Our sun is one of 400 billion stars in our galaxy, and we know that many other stars have planetary systems. Well, what about 10^22? And the other thing that one should take away from this chart is the very narrow range of time over which humans can claim to be the dominant intelligence on the planet. We are a small part of the story of cosmic evolution, and we are going to be responsible for our continued participation in that story, and perhaps SETI will help as well. If you look very hard here you can see the signal from the Voyager 1 spacecraft, the most distant human object in the universe, 106 times as far away from us as the sun is. In 2009, the U.N. has declared it to be the International Year of Astronomy, a global festival to help us residents of Earth rediscover our cosmic origins and our place in the universe.

376,"At the same time, I fell in love with New York City. Then I started going into the tunnels, which made me realize that there's a whole new dimension to the city that I never saw before and most people don't get to see. So I wanted to create a fictional character or an animal that dwells in these underground spaces, and the simplest way to do it, at the time, was to model myself. I was very fond of this space because it's the first massive industrial complex I found on my own that is abandoned. And, in a way, I wanted the human figure in the picture to become a part of that nature. Walking in this tunnel is very peaceful. This is the same tunnel. I was really frightened at first, but I calmly explained to him that I was working on an art project and he didn't seem to mind and so I went ahead and put my camera on self-timer and ran back and forth. So the bones were moved from the cemeteries into the quarries, making them into the catacombs.

377,"I'd like to take you all on a journey up to the forest canopy, and share with you what canopy researchers are asking and also how they're communicating with other people outside of science. (Music) (Growling) (Rustling) So what you'll see up there is that it's really like the atmosphere of an open field, and there are tremendous numbers of plants and animals that have adapted to make their way and their life in the canopy. Up in the canopy, if you were sitting next to me and you turned around from those primary forest ecosystems, you would also see scenes like this. And I'd like to just tell you one of our projects, which is the generation of Canopy Confluences. What I do is I bring together scientists and artists of all kinds, and we spend a week in the forest on these little platforms; and we look at nature, we look at trees, we look at the canopy, and we communicate, and exchange, and express what we see together. What can I, as an ecologist, do about that? Well, my thought was that I could learn how to grow mosses, and that way we wouldn't have to take them out of the wild. And I thought, if I had some partners that could help me with this, that would be great. Because the prison wardens were very enthusiastic about this as well, I started a Science and Sustainability Seminar in the prisons. Finally, as a scientist and as a person and now, as part of the TED community, I feel that I have better tools to go out to trees, to go out to forests, to go out to nature, to make new discoveries about nature -- and about humans' place in nature wherever we are and whomever you are.","scientists and artists of all kinds spend a week in the forest on platforms. they look at nature, look at trees, we look at the canopy, and we communicate. ecologist: ""i feel that as a scientist, i have better tools to go out to trees""","A unique ecosystem of plants, birds and monkeys thrives in the treetops of the rainforest.

378,"And the reason that that was the model    of beauty and of nature was because the decimal point had not been invented yet --    it wasn't the 16th century -- and everybody had to dimension a building    in terms of fractions, so a room would be dimensioned    as one-fourth of a facade; the structural dais of that might be dimensioned as 10 units, and you would get down to the small elements    by fractional subdivision:    finer and finer and finer. So, what's going on today    is that there's a model of natural form which is calculus-based    and which is using digital tools, and that has a lot of implications    to the way we think about beauty and form,    and it has a lot of implications in the way we think about nature. But what was important is,    the Gothic moment in architecture was the first time    that force and motion was thought of in terms of form. In all these examples,   there's one ideal form,   because these are thought in terms of structure. To just talk for a minute about the    digital mediums that we're using now    and how they integrate calculus: the fact that they're calculus-based    means that we don't have to think about dimension   in terms of ideal units    or discreet elements. That's because we're all using calculus tools    for manufacturing and for design. It also is much more dynamic,    so that you can see that the same form opens and closes    in a very dynamic way as you move across it,    because it has this quality of vector in motion   built into it. I think that's one of the main changes,    also, in architecture:    that we're starting to look now not for some ideal form, like a Latin cross for a church,    but actually all the traits of a church:   so, light that comes from behind from an invisible source,   directionality that focuses you towards an altar. So, for me, what was important is that    this coffee set -- which is just a coffee pot, a teapot,    and those are the pots sitting on a tray --    that they would have a coherence --   so, they would be Greg Lynn Alessi coffee pots --    but that everyone who bought one    would have a one-of-a-kind object that was unique in some way. So, the pattern and the form aren't the same thing,    but they really work together and are fused   in some way.",the Gothic moment in architecture was the first time force and motion was thought of in terms of form. the Gothic moment in architecture was the first time that force and motion was thought of in terms of form. the Gothic moment in architecture was the first time that force and motion was thought of in terms of form.,Greg Lynn talks about the mathematical roots of architecture -- and how calculus and digital tools allow modern designers to move beyond the traditional building forms.

379,"And so the next -- over the next six decades, believe it or not, I've built a number of aircraft, with the goal of creating something that could do for you, or me, what the hummingbird does, and give you that flexibility. When you get in the Skycar -- and I can tell you, there's only one other person that's flown it, but he had the same sensation -- you really feel like you're being lifted up by a magic carpet, without any vibration whatsoever. I only get to fly this vehicle occasionally, and only when I can persuade my stockholders to let me do so, but it's still one of those wonderful experiences that reward you for all that time. If we can get rid of that, then the highways will now be useful to you, as contrasted by what's happening in many parts of the world today. On this next slide, is an interesting history of what we really have seen in infrastructure, because whether I give you a perfect Skycar, the perfect vehicle for use, it's going to have very little value to you unless you've got a system to use it in. You're not going to be a pilot, you're going to be a passenger. Because if you're in this world, where computers are controlling what you're doing, it's going to be very critical that something can't fail on you. After all, if you can fly like that, why are you going to drive around on a highway? And I know the pilots in the audience aren't going to like that --  and I've had a lot of bad feedback from people who want to be up there, flying around and experiencing that.

380,"But it would be worse, except for that I happen to remember that over 20 years ago, when I was a teenager, when I first started telling people that I wanted to be a writer, I was met with this same sort of fear-based reaction. It just didn't come up like that, you know? I have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between me, as I am writing, and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be, from now on. They believed that a genius was this, sort of magical divine entity, who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist's studio, kind of like Dobby the house elf, and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work and would shape the outcome of that work. You know, I think that allowing somebody, one mere person to believe that he or she is like, the vessel, you know, like the font and the essence and the source of all divine, creative, unknowable, eternal mystery is just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile, human psyche. (Laughter) So when I heard that I was like -- that's uncanny, that's exactly what my creative process is like. (Laughter) That's not at all what my creative process is -- I'm not the pipeline!

384,"I've heard what I consider an extraordinary thing that I've only heard a little bit in the two previous TEDs, and what that is is an interweaving and an interlarding, an intermixing, of a sense of social responsibility in so many of the talks -- global responsibility, in fact, appealing to enlightened self-interest, but it goes far beyond enlightened self-interest. One of the most impressive things about what some, perhaps 10, of the speakers have been talking about is the realization, as you listen to them carefully, that they're not saying: Well, this is what we should do; this is what I would like you to do. And the only explanation I can have for some of what you've been hearing in the last four days is that it arises, in fact, out of a form of love. So, Sarah and I -- my wife -- walked over to the public library, which is four blocks away, on Pacific Street, and we got the OED, and we looked in there, and there are 14 definitions of hope, none of which really hits you between the eyes as being the appropriate one.

385,"Right when I was 15 was when I first got interested in solar energy. What if we collect the sun with a large reflector -- like I had been thinking about in high school, but maybe with modern technology we could make it cheaper -- concentrate it to a small converter, and then the conversion device wouldn't have to be as expensive, because it's much smaller, rather than solar cells, which have to cover the entire surface that you want to gather sun from. So we tried to look at all the different heat engines that have been used in history to convert sunlight or heat to electricity, And one of the great ones of all time, James Watt's steam engine of 1788 was a major breakthrough. So we tried to look at the Stirling engine in a new way, because it was practical -- weight no longer mattered for our application. So this is the engine. So you have the engine. This is what the first prototype of our system looked like with the petals and the engine in the center. But you can use it to optionally heat hot water and that brings the efficiency up even higher because some of the heat that you'd normally be rejecting, you can now use as useful energy, whether it's for a pool or hot water. So you don't have to just have a feel-good attitude about energy to want to have one of these. And it would be great if we could make our energy usage renewable, where as we're using the energy, we're creating it at the same pace, and I really hope we can get there.",solar energy is a renewable energy source that can be used to heat hot water. the engine can be used to convert sunlight or heat to electricity. the engine can also be used to heat a pool or hot water.,"Bill Gross, the founder of Idealab, talks about his life as an inventor, starting with his high-school company selling solar energy plans and kits.

And as these tools become more physical, more aware of their motion, aware of each other, and aware of the nuance of how we move them, we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles.

And the camera basically tracks these four fingers and recognizes any gestures that he's making so he can just go to, for example, a map of Long Beach, zoom in and out, etc. Another even more important difference is that in mass production, this would not cost more tomorrow than today's cell phones and would actually not sort of be a bigger packaging -- could look a lot more stylish than this version that I'm wearing around my neck. But other than letting some of you live out your fantasy of looking as cool as Tom Cruise in ""Minority Report,"" the reason why we're really excited about this device is that it really can act as one of these sixth-sense devices that gives you relevant information about whatever is in front of you. Some of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it rather than the most ecologically responsible choice. (Laughter) If he picks up a book in the bookstore, he can get an Amazon rating -- it gets projected right on the cover of the book. If he turns to a particular page, he finds an annotation by maybe an expert or a friend of ours that gives him a little bit of additional information about whatever is on that particular page.

392,"I was speaking to a group of about 300 kids, ages six to eight, at a children's museum, and I brought with me a bag full of legs, similar to the kinds of things you see up here, and had them laid out on a table for the kids. (Laughter) And just like that, I went from being a woman that these kids would have been trained to see as ""disabled"" to somebody that had potential that their bodies didn't have yet. So at the time, it was my opportunity to put a call out to innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic community to come bring their talent to the science and to the art of building legs.

393,"They're in a state of play. And social play is part of what we're about here today, and is a byproduct of the play scene. So what does play do for the brain? I think we've got a lot of learning to do. He had the expectations of his senatorial father and Washington, D.C. And although I think he certainly had the capacity for play -- because I do know something about that -- he wasn't as empowered, I think, as he now is by paying attention to what is his own passion and his own inner drive, which I think has its basis in all of us in our play history. But it doesn't have to be that way. (Applause) John Hockenberry: So it sounds to me like what you're saying is that there may be some temptation on the part of people to look at your work and go -- I think I've heard this, in my kind of pop psychological understanding of play, that somehow, the way animals and humans deal with play, is that it's some sort of rehearsal for adult activity. If you stop a cat from playing -- which you can do, and we've all seen how cats bat around stuff -- they're just as good predators as they would be if they hadn't played. So it's not just something you do in your spare time. SB: Well, I think the only way I know to do it is to have accumulated the advisers that I have who go from practitioners -- who can establish through improvisational play or clowning or whatever -- a state of play.","play is a byproduct of the play scene, and we've got a lot of learning to do, he says. he says he was not as empowered as he is now by paying attention to his own passion. he says people may be tempted to look at his work and go play as rehearsal for adult activity. he says play is not just something you do in your spare time.","A pioneer in research on play, Dr. Stuart Brown says humor, games, roughhousing, flirtation and fantasy are more than just fun.

394,"There is still a huge frustration that people have because we haven't got data on the web as data. So I want us now to think about not just two pieces of data being connected, or six like he did, but I want to think about a world where everybody has put data on the web and so virtually everything you can imagine is on the web and then calling that linked data. Second rule, if I take one of these HTTP names and I look it up and I do the web thing with it and I fetch the data using the HTTP protocol from the web, I will get back some data in a standard format which is kind of useful data that somebody might like to know about that thing, about that event. It's not just a root supplying a plant, but for each of those plants, whatever it is -- a presentation, an analysis, somebody's looking for patterns in the data -- they get to look at all the data and they get it connected together, and the really important thing about data is the more things you have to connect together, the more powerful it is. In fact, I'll just go into one area -- if you're looking at Alzheimer's, for example, drug discovery -- there is a whole lot of linked data which is just coming out because scientists in that field realize this is a great way of getting out of those silos, because they had their genomics data in one database in one building, and they had their protein data in another. Now if I go on like this, you'll think that all the data comes from huge institutions and has nothing to do with you. That's data. And that is what linked data is all about. So, we're at the stage now where we have to do this -- the people who think it's a great idea. And all the people -- and I think there's a lot of people at TED who do things because -- even though there's not an immediate return on the investment because it will only really pay off when everybody else has done it -- they'll do it because they're the sort of person who just does things which would be good if everybody else did them.",a lot of people at TED do things because they think it's a great idea. a lot of people at TED are the sort of person who just does things which would be good if everybody else did them. a lot of people at TED are the sort of person who just does things which would be good if everybody else did them.,"20 years ago, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web.

395,"Iâ€™m going around the world giving talks about Darwin, and usually what Iâ€™m talking about is Darwinâ€™s strange inversion of reasoning.

396,"And, you know, there's not much -- there wasn't much I could do, and they kept on doing what they were doing. And one of the most interesting lessons I learned was that there is an experimental method that if you have a question you can create a replica of this question in some abstract way, and you can try to examine this question, maybe learn something about the world. So that's what I did. And I would bring people to the lab and I would put their finger in it, and I would crunch it a little bit. And when I finished hurting people a little bit, I would ask them, so, how painful was this? If you were in the experiment, I would pass you a sheet of paper with 20 simple math problems that everybody could solve, but I wouldn't give you enough time. A third of the people we passed it to, they shredded it, they came to us and said, ""Mr. A third of the people, when they finished shredding the piece of paper, they came to us and said, ""Mr Experimenter, I solved X problems.

397,"And I thought to myself, wouldn't it be great if I had my own dodo skeleton? Russian nuclear launch key: The one on the top is the picture of the one I found on eBay; the one on the bottom is the one I made for myself, because I couldn't afford the one on eBay. But in this case, it's not about the author, it's not about the book or the movie or the story, it's about the object in and of itself. And then there is this fourth level, which is a whole new object in the world: the prop made for the movie, the representative of the thing, becomes, in its own right, a whole other thing, a whole new object of desire. I'd bought a replica, a really crappy replica, of the Maltese Falcon on eBay, and had downloaded enough pictures to actually have some reasonable reference. It was made out of resin, which wasn't a common material for movie props about the time the movie was made. It's funny to me that it took a while to authenticate it, because I can see it compared to this thing, and I can tell you -- it's real, it's the real thing, it's made from the exact same mold that this one is. But again, I am not a sculptor, and so I don't know a lot of the tricks, like, I don't know how my friend Mike gets beautiful, shiny surfaces with his Sculpey; I certainly wasn't able to get it. Now, the great thing about getting it to this point was that because in the movie, when they finally bring out the bird at the end, and they place it on the table, they actually spin it. And I can state with authority at this point in time, when I'd finished it, of all of the replicas out there -- and there is a few -- this is by far the most accurate representation of the original Maltese Falcon than anyone has sculpted.","a replica of the maltese Falcon was made out of resin, which wasn't a common material for movie props. it took a while to authenticate it, and it's the exact same mold that this one is. skeleton is the most accurate representation of the original maltese Falcon than anyone has sculpted.","Adam Savage talks about his fascination with the dodo bird, and how it led him on a strange and surprising double quest.

398,"My work is so personal and so strange that I have to invent my own lexicon for it. So the Hindenburg wasn't, you know, it was inevitable it was going to go.

399,"With the help of IIT, TERI, and learnings from NASA, we discovered that there are three basic green plants, common green plants, with which we can grow all the fresh air we need indoors to keep us healthy. Areca palm is a plant which removes CO2 and converts it into oxygen. We need four shoulder-high plants per person, and in terms of plant care, we need to wipe the leaves every day in Delhi, and perhaps once a week in cleaner-air cities. The third plant is money plant, and this is again a very common plant; preferably grows in hydroponics. With these three plants, you can grow all the fresh air you need. In fact, you could be in a bottle with a cap on top, and you would not die at all, and you would not need any fresh air. We have tried these plants at our own building in Delhi, which is a 50,000-square-feet, 20-year-old building. And the study showed that, compared to other buildings, there is a reduced incidence of eye irritation by 52 percent, respiratory systems by 34 percent, headaches by 24 percent, lung impairment by 12 percent and asthma by nine percent. It is also important for the environment, because the world's energy requirements are expected to grow by 30 percent in the next decade. 40 percent of the world's energy is taken up by buildings currently, and 60 percent of the world's population will be living in buildings in cities with a population of over one million in the next 15 years.",the world's energy requirements are expected to grow by 30 percent in the next decade. 40 percent of the world's energy is taken up by buildings currently. 60 percent of the world's population will be living in buildings in cities with a population of over one million.,"Researcher Kamal Meattle shows how an arrangement of three common houseplants, used in specific spots in a home or office building, can result in measurably cleaner indoor air."

And they can now span up to three hundred feet at the hub height, but they can't really go a lot higher, and more height is where the more wind is, and more power -- as much as twice as much.

405,"In those days, those days which exist for me only as the most elusive memory now, when often the first sound you'd hear in the morning would be a storm of birdsong, then the soft clop of the hooves of the horse hauling a milk wagon down your block, and the last sound at night as likely as not would be your father pulling up in his car, having worked late again, always late, and going heavily down to the cellar, to the furnace, to shake out the ashes and damp the draft before he came upstairs to fall into bed -- in those long-ago days, women, my mother, my friends' mothers, our neighbors, all the women I knew -- wore, often much of the day, what were called housedresses, cheap, printed, pulpy, seemingly purposefully shapeless light cotton shifts that you wore over your nightgown and, when you had to go look for a child, hang wash on the line, or run down to the grocery store on the corner, under a coat, the twisted hem of the nightgown always lank and yellowed, dangling beneath. More than the curlers some of the women seemed constantly to have in their hair in preparation for some great event -- a ball, one would think -- that never came to pass; more than the way most women's faces not only were never made up during the day, but seemed scraped, bleached, and, with their plucked eyebrows, scarily masklike; more than all that it was those dresses that made women so unknowable and forbidding, adepts of enigmas to which men could have no access, and boys no conception. In those days, one hid much else as well: grown men didn't embrace one another, unless someone had died, and not always then; you shook hands or, at a ball game, thumped your friend's back and exchanged blows meant to be codes for affection; once out of childhood you'd never again know the shock of your father's whiskers on your cheek, not until mores at last had evolved, and you could hug another man, then hold on for a moment, then even kiss (your fathers bristles white and stiff now).

That seemed really like a crisis to me, that they had never been able to develop a vocabulary about escape, and about travel, and modernity in this trailer that was consistent with the shell. We really needed to do some archeology in the trailer itself to figure out what's authentic in an Airstream trailer, and what feels like it has true purpose and utility. The biggest difficulty on one of these trailers is that when you're designing there's actually no logical place to stop and start materials because of the continuous form of the trailer. What I had to devise was a way of fooling the eye into believing that all these panels are curved with the shell. What I came up with was a series of second skins that basically float over the aluminum shell. And what I was trying to do there was direct your eye in the space, so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way, and that the casework wouldn't break up the space. Trailer number two, you have a blank slate, you can to anything you want. They came to me and said, ""Well, what can we do to freshen this thing up? So the problem became -- and they set this dilemma to me -- that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology, and there's no money for tooling or molding.","an old Airstream trailer was gutted to give it a fresh, new contemporary look. a series of second skins float over the aluminum shell, fooling the eye into thinking it's curved with the shell. the interior is done using only our existing technology, and there's no money for tooling or molding.","In this low-key, image-packed talk from 2002, designer Christopher C.

409,"What we're going to do is actually just flash a series of photos behind me that show you the reality of robots used in war right now or already at the prototype stage. We now have 5,300. One of the people that I recently met with was an Air Force three-star general, and he said basically, where we're headed very soon is tens of thousands of robots operating in our conflicts, and these numbers matter, because we're not just talking about tens of thousands of today's robots, but tens of thousands of these prototypes and tomorrow's robots, because of course, one of the things that's operating in technology is Moore's Law, that you can pack in more and more computing power into those robots, and so flash forward around 25 years, if Moore's Law holds true, those robots will be close to a billion times more powerful in their computing than today. I've spent the last several years going around meeting with all the players in this field, from the robot scientists to the science fiction authors who inspired them to the 19-year-old drone pilots who are fighting from Nevada, to the four-star generals who command them, to even the Iraqi insurgents who they are targeting and what they think about our systems, and what I found interesting is not just their stories, but how their experiences point to these ripple effects that are going outwards in our society, in our law and our ethics, etc. So the first is that the future of war, even a robotics one, is not going to be purely an American one. And now we have the fact that we're converting more and more of our American soldiers that we would send into harm's way into machines, and so we may take those already lowering bars to war and drop them to the ground. The typical one that I was sent was an email that had an attachment of video of a Predator strike taking out an enemy site. But we have to remember, these are just the clips. They see an 80-year-old grandmother in a wheelchair the same way they see a T-80 tank: they're both just a series of zeroes and ones. Now, I could be wrong on this, and one Pentagon robot scientist told me that I was.","john avlon: we're going to have 5,300 robots used in war right now or at prototype stage. avlon: the future of war, even a robotics one, is not going to be purely an american one. avlon: we're converting more and more of our american soldiers into machines. avlon: we're going to have more and more robots, and we're going to have more of them.","In this powerful talk, P.W.

410,"And that ends with a little clip of my father, of Lou, talking about something that is very dear to him, which is the accidents of life. It is the capital of the country, and it took 23 years to build, which is something they seem to be very proud of over there. The building was finished in 1983. Think about that when you see that building, that sometimes the things we strive for so hard in life we never get to see finished. And that really struck me about my father, in the sense that he had such belief that somehow, doing these things giving in the way that he gave, that something good would come out of it, even in the middle of a war, there was a war with Pakistan at one point, and the construction stopped totally and he kept working, because he felt, ""Well when the war is done they'll need this building."" You know he'd be in the office till three in the morning working with us and there was this kind of sense of the nomad in him. In that way it is so relevant. He paid his life for this, and that is why he is great and we'll remember him. In social aspect of his life he was just like a child, he was not at all matured.

411,"What I'm going to try to do is explain to you quickly how to predict, and illustrate it with some predictions about what Iran is going to do in the next couple of years. In order to look out for what's best for them or what they think is best for them, people have values -- they identify what they want, and what they don't want. Now in order to work out what people are going to do to pursue their interests, we have to think about who has influence in the world. If we're looking at Iran, the president of the United States we would like to think, may have some influence -- certainly the president in Iran has some influence -- but we make a mistake if we just pay attention to the person at the top of the power ladder because that person doesn't know much about Iran, or about energy policy, or about health care, or about any particular policy. There are lots of people shaping decisions and so if we want to predict correctly we have to pay attention to everybody who is trying to shape the outcome, not just the people at the pinnacle of the decision-making pyramid. We need to know what they say they want, not what they want in their heart of hearts, not what they think they can get, but what they say they want, because that is a strategically chosen position, and we can work backwards from that to draw inferences about important features of their decision-making. So with just that little bit of input we can work out what the choices are that people have, what the chances are that they're willing to take, what they're after, what they value, what they want, and what they believe about other people. How they got to where they are may be important in shaping the input information, but once we know where they are we're worried about where they're going to be headed in the future. If they don't know, who are the people trying to influence the decision, how much clout do they have, how much they care about this issue, and what do they say they want, are they experts? BBM: Well, people of Iran, this is what many of you are going to evolve to want, and we could get there a lot sooner, and you would suffer a lot less trouble from economic sanctions, and we would suffer a lot less fear of the use of military force on our end, and the world would be a better place.","john avlon: people have values, they identify what they want, and what they don't want. avlon: we make a mistake if we pay attention to the person at the top of the power ladder. avlon: we need to know what they say they want, not what they think they can get.","Bruce Bueno de Mesquita uses mathematical analysis to predict (very often correctly) such messy human events as war, political power shifts, Intifada ...

412,"I know you guys think of yourself as humans, and this is sort of how I think of you. There's about a trillion human cells that make each one of us who we are and able to do all the things that we do. So there's all kinds of bacteria on the earth that have no business being in you or on you at any time, and if they are, they make you incredibly sick. And what we figured out is that the way they do that is they talk to each other, and they talk with a chemical language. But what it does do is to make and secrete small molecules that you can think of like hormones, and these are the red triangles. (Laughter) But then if you think about it, this squid has this terrible problem, because it's got this dying, thick culture of bacteria, and it can't sustain that. Why this is interesting is because in the past decade, we have found that this is not just some anomaly of this ridiculous, glow-in-the-dark bacterium that lives in the ocean -- all bacteria have systems like this. But what they do, we now understand, is they get in you, they wait, they start growing, they count themselves with these little molecules, and they recognize when they have the right cell number that if all of the bacteria launch their virulence attack together, they're going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host. They all have a species-specific system, they have a molecule that says ""me."" What I hope you think is that bacteria can talk to each other, they use chemicals as their words, they have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon that we're just now starting to learn about.","a trillion human cells make each of us who we are and able to do all the things that we do. bacteria talk to each other, use chemicals as their words, and have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon. squid has this terrible problem because it's got this dying, thick culture of bacteria.","Bonnie Bassler discovered that bacteria ""talk"" to each other, using a chemical language that lets them coordinate defense and mount attacks.

415,"And then sort of through a process of wandering around, I got to the thought that actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars, in a way that is convenient and affordable, you could get to a solution. The thought that came to mind is that it needs to be as good as any car that you would have today. How do you do it within the economics that we have today? If you park your car and didn't plug in the heater, when you come back you don't have a car. First he let me go to the prime minister of the country, who told me, if you can find the money you need for this network, 200 million dollars, and if you can find a car company that will build that car in mass volume, in two million cars -- that's what we needed in Israel -- I'll give you country to invest the 200 million into.

The business model in which the money that is actually coming in, to drive the car -- the minutes, the miles if you want, that you are all familiar with -- subsidize the price of the car, just like cellphones.

416,"The future of life, where the unraveling of our biology -- and bring up the lights a little bit. And yet, I don't really think it is because when it comes down to it, it's this larger trajectory that is really what is going to remain -- what people in the future are going to remember about this period. So it's not surprising that some people would wonder whether maybe 30 or 40 years from now, we'll look back at this instant in time, and all of the sort of talk about the Human Genome Project, and what all this is going to mean to us -- well, it will really mean precious little. Because when we talk about our genetics and our biology, and modifying and altering and adjusting these things, we're talking about changing ourselves. And look around you and know that what we really care about is that little bit of difference. And if you don't, who are you going to be? But when something is feasible in thousands of laboratories all over the world, which is going to be the case with these technologies, when there are large numbers of people who see them as beneficial, which is already the case, and when they're almost impossible to police, it's not a question of if this is going to happen, it's when and where and how it's going to happen.

Women are much more in balance because they don't have that idea that they're going to be able to do 100 pull-ups. They think about how to get the weight over their feet because it's sort of natural -- they carry you all day long. And of course there is rule number nine. I came up with rule number nine after I actually didn't plan for a fall, and went about 40 feet and cracked a rib. Once you get to that point where you know it's going to happen, you need to start thinking about how you're going to let go because that is the critical piece of not getting hurt -- how you're going to fall onto the rope, or if you're climbing without a rope, fall to a place where you can actually control the fall.","the most friction you have is when you first put your hand or your foot on the rock. rule number nine: don't fall onto the rope, or if you're climbing without a rope, fall to a place where you can control the fall.","In this talk from TED University 2009, veteran rock climber Matthew Childs shares nine pointers for rock climbing.

So I had to give up the approach of drawing the fantasy shapes and convert it to technical drawings -- the shape of the wing, the shape of the fuselage and so on -- and build an airplane over these drawings that I knew followed some of the principles of flying. And it had, once it was in the air, some of this romance that I was in love with. And the loose ideas had something to do with what I knew happened with people in the office, at the work place -- people who worked, and used task seating, a great many of them sitting in front of a computer all day long. So I took the approach that the chair should do as much for them as humanly possible or as mechanistically possible so that they didn't have to fuss with it.

422,"But there is also this part of the country, kind of in the middle region here. And we think people like this probably don't want to vote for people who look like this and are named Barack Obama. Actually we didn't ask them, but when they conducted exit polls in every state, in 37 states, out of the 50, they asked a question, that was pretty direct, about race. So you see big differences in different parts of the country on this question. You kind of see the relationship between the redder states of where more people responded and said, ""Yes, Barack Obama's race was a problem for me."" And so we can look at a bunch of different variables. And there are a couple of these that have strong predictive relationships, one of which is education, where you see the states with the fewest years of schooling per adult are in red, and you see this part of the country, the kind of Appalachians region, is less educated. So it's the combination of these two things: it's education and the type of neighbors that you have, which we'll talk about more in a moment. So what we're going to do now is take the white people in the survey and split them between those who have black neighbors -- or, really, some neighbor of another race -- and people who have only white neighbors. And even some questions about race -- for example affirmative action, which is kind of a political question, a policy question about race, if you will -- not much difference here.","in 37 states, out of the 50, they asked a question about race. john avlon: you see big differences in different parts of the country on this question. he says education and type of neighbors have strong predictive relationships. avlon: we'll talk about more in a moment.","Nate Silver has data that answers big questions about race in politics.

Think about the changes that occur in the brain of a child through the course of acquiring their movement behavior abilities in general. We now have a large body of literature that demonstrates that the fundamental problem that occurs in the majority of children that have early language impairments, and that are going to struggle to learn to read, is that their language processor is created in a defective form.

431,"But I think it does matter which way we go and what road we take, because when I think about design in the near future, what I think are the most important issues, what's really crucial and vital, is that we need to revitalize the arts and sciences right now, in 2002. (Applause) If we describe the near future as 10, 20, 15 years from now, that means that what we do today is going to be critically important, because in the year 2015, in the year 2020, 2025, the world our society is going to be building on, the basic knowledge and abstract ideas, the discoveries that we came up with today, just as all these wonderful things we're hearing about here at the TED conference that we take for granted in the world right now, were really knowledge and ideas that came up in the 50s, the 60s and the 70s. What do we have to do? But I'm going to let you know that some folks in the outside world, believe it or not, think it's neat when they say, ""Scientists and science is not creative.

How does understanding science and the arts fit into our lives and what's going on and the things we're talking about here at the design conference? That doesn't mean that everything has to have one thing that's going to go on, or that we know exactly what's going to be the outcome of it, but that we support the vitality and the intellectual curiosity that goes along [with it]. So we have to really stop and think: What are we trying to do with the sciences and the arts?

437,"The third set of ideas are what I call as ""ideas that we argue about"" -- those are ideas where we have a fight, an ideological battle about how to do things. Because when you are a developing country in the world where you can see the problems that other countries are having, you can actually anticipate what that did and do things very differently. India is going to have a lot of young people with a demographic dividend for the next 30 years. What is unique about this demographic dividend is that India will be the only country in the world to have this demographic dividend. I believe these six factors -- the rise of the notion of population as human capital, the rise of Indian entrepreneurs, the rise of English as a language of aspiration, technology as something empowering, globalization as a positive factor, and the deepening of democracy -- has contributed to why India is today growing at rates it has never seen before. Therefore we need to create a new set of labor laws, which are not as onerous as they are today. At the same time give a policy for a lot more people to be in the formal sector, and create the jobs for the millions of people that we need to create jobs for. The first thing is, we're very fortunate that technology is at a point where it is much more advanced than when other countries had the development. And it is important to prove that growth and democracy are not incompatible, that you can have a democracy, that you can have an open society, and you can have growth. When India was growing at about three, 3.5 percent and the population was growing at two percent, its per capita income was doubling every 45 years.",india will be the only country in the world to have this demographic dividend for the next 30 years. india is growing at rates it has never seen before. we need to create a new set of labor laws that are not as onerous as they are today.,"Nandan Nilekani, the visionary co-founder of outsourcing pioneer Infosys, explains four brands of ideas that will determine whether India can continue its recent breakneck progress."

This region seen here for the first time in the Cassini image taken in 2005. And I also reported that we'd made this mind-blowing discovery -- this once-in-a-lifetime discovery of towering jets erupting from those fractures at the south pole, consisting of tiny water ice crystals accompanied by water vapor and simple organic compounds like carbon dioxide and methane. And at that time two years ago I mentioned that we were speculating that these jets might in fact be geysers, and erupting from pockets or chambers of liquid water underneath the surface, but we weren't really sure. However, the implications of those results -- of a possible environment within this moon that could support prebiotic chemistry, and perhaps life itself -- were so exciting that, in the intervening two years, we have focused more on Enceladus. While they're not amino acids, we're now finding things like propane and benzene, hydrogen cyanide, and formaldehyde. So we are very encouraged by these results. And we are much more confident now than we were two years ago that we might indeed have on this moon, under the south pole, an environment or a zone that is hospitable to living organisms. But in the meantime I invite you to imagine the day when we might journey to the Saturnine system, and visit the Enceladus interplanetary geyser park, just because we can.

And we decided that what we want to store first of all, are the species that are most under threat. And the main thing is that you have to dry them very carefully, at low temperature. And these seeds will be able to germinate, we believe, with many of the species, in thousands of years, and certainly in hundreds of years. That means that we know the right combination of heat and cold and the cycles that you have to get to make the seed germinate. And then we grow these things, and we tell people, back in the countries where these seeds have come from, ""Look, actually we're not just storing this to get the seeds later, but we can give you this information about how to germinate these difficult plants."" So in habitats that have already been damaged, like the tall grass prairie here in the USA, or in mined land in various countries, restoration is already happening because of these species -- and because of this collection.","a seed bank will store the species that are most under threat. the seeds will be able to germinate with many of the species, in thousands of years. restoration is already happening because of these species.","In this brief talk from TED U 2009, Jonathan Drori encourages us to save biodiversity -- one seed at a time.

And after that, most likely it's going to begin to decline. But look what happened in Europe after the plague: rising wages, land reform, technological innovation, birth of the middle class; and after that, forward-looking social movements like the Renaissance, and later the Enlightenment. But I think we're in for another change, about two generations after the top of that curve, once the effects of a declining population start to settle in. So why does this matter? Why talk about social-economic movements that may be more than a century away?

Absent from this list, and absent from any discussions of happiness, are happiness in another's happiness. There was once a statement made by a psychologist that said that 80 percent of the pursuit of happiness is really just about the genes, and it's as difficult to become happier as it is to become taller. There is a decent contribution to happiness from the genes -- about 50 percent -- but there is still that 50 percent that is unaccounted for. It turned out that it wasn't, that it really is a system of motivation, a system of wanting. And one of them, of course, is biophilia -- that we have a response to the natural world that's very profound. The other thing is, that a piece of evidence is, is if you look at computerized text analysis of people who commit suicide, what you find there, and it's quite interesting, is use of the first person singular -- ""I,"" ""me,"" ""my,"" not ""we"" and ""us"" -- and the letters are less hopeless than they are really alone.

460,"I want to talk about the transformed media landscape, and what it means for anybody who has a message that they want to get out to anywhere in the world. If you want to address a group, you get the same message and you give it to everybody in the group, whether you're doing that with a broadcasting tower or a printing press. That was the media landscape as we had it in the twentieth century. The Internet is the first medium in history that has native support for groups and conversation at the same time. And the earthquake was reported as it was happening. And so as the quake was happening the news was reported. And the Chinese then, in one of their periods of media openness, decided that they were going to let it go, that they were going to let this citizen reporting fly. And it was produced at such an incredible abundance that there was no way to filter it as it appeared. In a world where media is global, social, ubiquitous and cheap, in a world of media where the former audience are now increasingly full participants, in that world, media is less and less often about crafting a single message to be consumed by individuals. And the choice we face, I mean anybody who has a message they want to have heard anywhere in the world, isn't whether or not that is the media environment we want to operate in.","the internet is the first medium in history that has native support for groups and conversation at the same time. in a world where media is global, social, ubiquitous and cheap, the former audience are now increasingly full participants.","While news from Iran streams to the world, Clay Shirky shows how Facebook, Twitter and TXTs help citizens in repressive regimes to report on real news, bypassing censors (however briefly).

462,"So in order to give you some kind of a perspective of where we are right now with surgical robots, and where we're going to be going in the future, I want to give you a little bit of perspective of how we got to this point, how we even came to believe that surgery was OK, that this was something that was possible to do, that this kind of cutting and reforming was OK. Because we were in the age before anesthesia, the agony of the patient is really as much of the public spectacle as the surgery itself. So what you see -- this is now the first surgical image -- as we're coming down the tube, this is a new entry into the body. So what you need to do, to take the capability of your hand, and put it on the other side of that small incision, is you need to put a wrist on that instrument. But what this lets you do is gives you that all-important traction, and counter-traction, so that you can dissect, so that you can sew, so that you can do all the things that you need to do, all the surgical tasks. This is all they're going to see. As we take these capabilities, and we get to go to the next places, we get to decide what our new surgeries are going to be. We can inject these dyes into the bloodstream, so that when we do a new vessel and we bypass a blockage on the heart, we can see if we actually made the connection, before we close that patient back up again -- something that we haven't been able to do without radiation before. So this is all very prototypey at this point. So, with the combination of these technologies we can reach it all, and we can see it all.","robots allow surgeons to do all the things they need to do, all the surgical tasks. we can inject dyes into the bloodstream, so we can bypass a blockage on the heart. with the combination of these technologies we can reach it all, and we can see it all.","Surgeon and inventor Catherine Mohr tours the history of surgery (and its pre-painkiller, pre-antiseptic past), then demos some of the newest tools for surgery through tiny incisions, performed using nimble robot hands.

So the rawness, I think, in space, the fact that sustainability can actually, in the future translate into a raw space, a space that isn't decorated, a space that is not mannered in any source, but a space that might be cool in terms of its temperature, might be refractive to our desires. It should not play it safe, because if it plays it safe it's not moving us in a direction that we want to be. And of course that is finally what I believe architecture to be. And I think that is really the nature of architecture.","architecture is something suspended between what we believe we can be, and a tradition we may have forgotten. we are all about the struggle of emotions, and that's part of what the complexity of architecture is. if architecture plays it safe it's not moving us in a direction that we want to be.","Daniel Libeskind builds on very big ideas.

The third part that I'd like to talk about is the limbic system. So the combination of these processing centers help us make meaning in very different ways. So what can we learn about this? So, for example, when you look at this image a good graphic invites the eye to dart around, to selectively create a visual logic. So the point of this is what? We make meaning by seeing, by an act of visual interrogation. Secondly make those images interactive so that we engage much more fully.

And it was at that time that my mother got word from the commune chief that the Vietnamese were actually asking for their citizens to go back to Vietnam. And she decided, despite the advice of her neighbors, that she would take the chance and claim to be Vietnamese so that we could have a chance to survive, because at this point they're forcing everybody to work. And my mother's Vietnamese was so bad that to make our story more credible, she'd given all the boys and girls new Vietnamese names. And this is a picture of Hong Ngu, Vietnam today.

473,"And I was pulling a molecule out of this bag. And I was thinking that your body hated it, at the time, because we are very immune to this. Now, I was thinking about that and I said, you know, we've got this immune response to this ridiculous molecule that we don't make, and we see it a lot in other animals and stuff. (Laughter) So you can take a bacteria that really doesn't make these things at all, and if you could clamp these on it really well you have it taken off the street.

475,"With such a big space, the problem is obviously that there is a discrepancy between what your body can embrace, and what the space, in that sense, is.

It doesn't really tell you what you're looking at. If you have a waterfall in there, right out there at the horizon; you look at the waterfall and you go, ""Oh, the water is falling really slowly.""

478,"Now what is so interesting and to some, the extent, what's a bit infamous about ""The Origin of Species,"" is that there is only one line in it about human evolution. And what Darwin could not appreciate, or didn't perhaps want to appreciate at the time, is that there was a fundamental relationship between the intensity of ultraviolet radiation and skin pigmentation. And that skin pigmentation itself was a product of evolution. So, it's wonderful. This had tremendous consequences for the evolution of human skin pigmentation. What they haven't been so good about instructing people is the problem of darkly pigmented people living in high latitude areas, or working inside all the time. So we have, in skin pigmentation, one of these wonderful products of evolution that still has consequences for us today. But we need to think about how he compares, in terms of his pigmentation, to other people on Earth.

479,"What they have in common is what we see unlocks what we cannot see. What these pictures demonstrate is that there is a moral sense across all religions, across all faiths, across all continents -- a moral sense that not only do we share the pain of others, and believe in something bigger than ourselves but we have a duty to act when we see things that are wrong that need righted, see injuries that need to be corrected, see problems that need to be rectified. We now have the capacity to find common ground with people who we will never meet, but who we will meet through the Internet and through all the modern means of communication; that we now have the capacity to organize and take collective action together to deal with the problem or an injustice that we want to deal with; and I believe that this makes this a unique age in human history, and it is the start of what I would call the creation of a truly global society. She was so appalled by what was happening in Austria as a result of the First World War and what was happening to children who were part of the defeated families of Austria, that in Britain she wanted to take action, but she had to go house to house, leaflet to leaflet, to get people to attend a rally in the Royal Albert Hall that eventually gave birth to Save the Children, an international organization that is now fully recognized as one of the great institutions in our land and in the world. I was with Nelson Mandela a year ago, when he was in London. Is it not absolutely scandalous that we have a situation where we know that there is a climate change problem, where we know also that that will mean we have to give more resources to the poorest countries to deal with that, when we want to create a global carbon market, but there is no global institution that people have been able to agree upon to deal with this problem? (Applause) One of the reasons why an institution is not in itself enough is that we have got to persuade people around the world to change their behavior as well, so you need that global ethic of fairness and responsibility across the generations. We do not have the basis of a proper partnership for the future, and yet, out of peopleâ€™s desire for a global ethic and a global society that can be done. When you looked in her eyes, any girl at the age of eleven is looking forward to the future, but there was an unreachable sadness in that girlâ€™s eyes and if I could have translated that to the rest of the world for that moment, I believe that all the work that it had done for the global HIV/AIDS fund would be rewarded by people being prepared to make donations. That global ethic can infuse the fairness and responsibility that is necessary for these institutions to work, but we should not lose the chance in this generation, in this decade in particular, with President Obama in America, with other people working with us around the world, to create global institutions for the environment, and for finance, and for security and for development, that make sense of our responsibility to other peoples, our desire to bind the world together, and our need to tackle problems that everybody knows exist.","sally kohn: what we see unlocks what we cannot see. kohn: we have a moral sense across all religions, across all faiths, across all continents. she says we have the capacity to organize and take collective action together. kohn: we have got to persuade people around the world to change their behavior.","We're at a unique moment in history, says UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown: we can use today's interconnectedness to develop our shared global ethic -- and work together to confront the challenges of poverty, security, climate change and the economy."
480,"I'm mentioning all this -- I'm mentioning all this because I think this is not merely a personal problem; you may think I'm wrong in this, but I think we live in an age when our lives are regularly punctuated by career crises, by moments when what we thought we knew -- about our lives, about our careers -- comes into contact with a threatening sort of reality. I want to look now, if I may, at some of the reasons why we might be feeling anxiety about our careers. I think there is. (Laughter) (Applause) In a way, if you like, at one end of the spectrum of sympathy, you've got the tabloid newspaper. And I think that is the message of tragedy to us, and why it's so very, very important, I think. We are the first society to be living in a world where we don't worship anything other than ourselves. And the thing about a successful life is that a lot of the time, our ideas of what it would mean to live successfully are not our own. So what I want to argue for is not that we should give up on our ideas of success, but we should make sure that they are our own. Because it's bad enough not getting what you want, but it's even worse to have an idea of what it is you want, and find out, at the end of the journey, that it isn't, in fact, what you wanted all along. But how do you reconcile this idea of it being bad to think of someone as a ""loser,"" with the idea that a lot of people like, of seizing control of your life, and that a society that encourages that, perhaps has to have some winners and losers?","a lot of the time, our ideas of what it would mean to live successfully are not our own. a lot of the time, our ideas of what it would mean to live successfully are not our own. a lot of people like, of seizing control of their lives, a society that encourages that.","Alain de Botton examines our ideas of success and failure -- and questions the assumptions underlying these two judgments.

There is only one circumstance in which they always, all of them, walk on two legs, and that is when they are wading through water. Well they do know, that if you look at other aquatic mammals, the fat that in most land mammals is deposited inside the body wall, around the kidneys and the intestines and so on, has started to migrate to the outside, and spread out in a layer inside the skin. And the ironic thing about it is that they are not staving off the aquatic theory to protect a theory of their own, which they've all agreed on, and they love. Of course they don't believe it, but they like it."" And they can't all be wrong, can they?""

485,"I want to argue that there is a general abstract insight that we can make practical, which is that, if we can give more choices to people, and more choices to leaders -- who, in many countries, are also people. But if we can find ways to give more choices to both, that will give us a set of rules for changing rules that get us out of traps. And he says that if you want to see the damaging effects of rules, the ways that rules can keep people in the dark, look at the pictures from NASA of the earth at night. If you try to change the rules in a village, you could do that, but a village would be too small to get the kinds of benefits you can get if you have millions of people all working under good rules. We start with a charter that specifies all the rules required to attract the people who we'll need to build the city. This model is all about choices, both for leaders and for the people who will live in these new places. Now, if we generalize this and think about not just one or two charter cites, but dozens -- cities that will help create places for the many hundreds of millions, perhaps billions of people who will move to cities in the coming century -- is there enough land for them? So if we wanted to build cities for another billion people, they would be dots like this. The reason we can be so well off, even though there is so many people on earth, is because of the power of ideas. If we can keep innovating on our space of rules, and particularly innovate in the sense of coming up with rules for changing rules, so we don't get stuck with bad rules, then we can keep moving progress forward and truly make the world a better place, so that people like Nelson and his friends don't have to study any longer under the streetlights.","john avlon: if we can give more choices to people, and more choices to leaders, we can change rules. avlon: if we can find ways to give more choices to both, that will give us a set of rules. he says we can keep innovating on our space of rules so we don't get stuck with bad rules. avlon: if we can keep innovating on our space of rules, we can keep moving progress forward","How can a struggling country break out of poverty if it's trapped in a system of bad rules?

These contingent motivators -- if you do this, then you get that -- work in some circumstances. Everybody in this room is dealing with their own version of the candle problem. I'm an American; I don't believe in philosophy. And if we really want to get out of this economic mess, if we really want high performance on those definitional tasks of the 21st century, the solution is not to do more of the wrong things, to entice people with a sweeter carrot, or threaten them with a sharper stick. How they do it, when they do it, where they do it, is totally up to them. Do it because you like to do it. So, if we repair this mismatch between science and business, if we bring our motivation, notions of motivation into the 21st century, if we get past this lazy, dangerous, ideology of carrots and sticks, we can strengthen our businesses, we can solve a lot of those candle problems, and maybe, maybe -- we can change the world.","jeffrey toobin: 20 years ago, i did something that I regret, something that I'm not particularly proud of. toobin: if we repair this mismatch between science and business, we can strengthen our businesses. he says we can solve a lot of those candle problems, and maybe, maybe, we can change the world. toobin: if we get past this lazy, dangerous, ideology of carrots and sticks, we can strengthen our businesses.","Career analyst Dan Pink examines the puzzle of motivation, starting with a fact that social scientists know but most managers don't: Traditional rewards aren't always as effective as we think.

489,"The thought that you wouldn't want to transfer electric power wirelessly, no one ever thought of that. And for those of us that have an environmental element to us, there is something like 40 billion disposable batteries built every year for power that, generally speaking, is used within a few inches or a few feet of where there is very inexpensive power. So fortunately, one of the other definitions of ""suck"" that was in there, it does create a vacuum. And those two coils of wire are really, really close to each other, and actually do transfer power magnetically and wirelessly, only over a very short distance. What Dr. Soljacic figured out how to do was separate the coils in a transformer to a greater distance than the size of those transformers using this technology, which is not dissimilar from the way an opera singer shatters a glass on the other side of the room. Imagine driving into your garage -- we've built a system to do this -- you drive into your garage, and the car charges itself, because there is a mat on the floor that's plugged into the wall. But then what's going to happen is, it will create a field. The 10 seconds actually are because we -- I don't know if any of you have ever thought about plugging a T.V. So I thought we put a little computer in it that has to wake up to tell it to do that. And think of what that would do for you.","bob greene: 40 billion disposable batteries are built every year for power. he says a transformer can transfer power magnetically and wirelessly, only over a short distance. he says it's not dissimilar to the way an opera singer shatters a glass on the other side of the room. greene: we've built a system to do this -- we drive into your garage and the car charges itself.","Eric Giler wants to untangle our wired lives with cable-free electric power.

492,"Now, imagine each one of these varieties as being distinct from another about the same way as a poodle from a Great Dane. So if I were to going to show you all the beans in the world, and I had a slide like this, and I switched it every second, it would take up my entire TED talk, and I wouldn't have to say anything. And the Fowler apple is described in here -- I hope this doesn't surprise you -- as, ""a beautiful fruit."" I want to show you two slides, but first, I want to tell you that we've been working at the Global Crop Diversity Trust with a number of scientists -- particularly at Stanford and University of Washington -- to ask the question: What's going to happen to agriculture in an era of climate change and what kind of traits and characteristics do we need in our agricultural crops to be able to adapt to this? In short, the answer is that in the future, in many countries, the coldest growing seasons are going to be hotter than anything those crops have seen in the past. By 2030, if the maize, or corn, varieties, which is the dominant crop -- 50 percent of the nutrition in Southern Africa are still in the field -- in 2030, we'll have a 30 percent decrease in production of maize because of the climate change already in 2030. We have collected and conserved a great deal of biological diversity, agricultural diversity, mostly in the form of seed, and we put it in seed banks, which is a fancy way of saying a freezer. So, a number of us got together and decided that, you know, enough is enough and we need to do something about that and we need to have a facility that can really offer protection for our biological diversity of -- maybe not the most charismatic diversity. I can't look you in the eyes and tell you that I have a solution for climate change, for the water crisis. I can't look you in the eyes and tell you that I have a simple solution for that, but I can look you in the eyes and tell you that we can't solve any of those problems if we don't have crop diversity.","by 2030, we'll have a 30 percent decrease in production of maize because of climate change. by 2030, if the dominant crop is still in the field, we'll have a 30 percent decrease in production of maize. we need to have a facility that can really offer protection for our biological diversity.","The wheat, corn and rice we grow today may not thrive in a future threatened by climate change.

493,"But it looks like -- I'm guessing -- that it'll be about 60 percent of the room because that's roughly the fraction of developed world population that have some sort of vision correction. And the problem of poor vision, is actually not just a health problem, it's also an educational problem, and it's an economic problem, and it's a quality of life problem. The problem is, there aren't enough eye care professionals in the world to use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear that we have in the developed world. In fact, there are some countries in sub-Saharan Africa where there's one optometrist for eight million of the population. And the idea is you make eye glasses, and you adjust them yourself and that solves the problem. What I want to do is to show you that one can make a pair of glasses. I shall just show you how you make a pair of glasses. And that vision is to try to get a billion people wearing the glasses they need by the year 2020.

494,"What I'm going to try and do is to give some pointers to what I think is the landscape on the other side of the crisis, what things we should be looking out for and how we can actually use the crisis. And I want to talk about how we ensure that this crisis, which is by no means small, really is used to the full. But what I want to talk about begins when I was at this city, this university, as a student. We've got to do whatever we can to help them, but we've also got to ask, I think, a more profound question of whether we use this crisis to jump forward to a different kind of economy that's more suited to human needs, to a better balance of economy and society. And I think you can see around us now, some of the green shoots of a very different kind of economy and capitalism which could grow. And I'm a very small part of a very large movement, which for some people is about survival, but is also about values, about a different kind of economy, which isn't so much about consumption and credit, but about things which matter to us. And everywhere, as people think about the unprecedented sums which are being spent of our money and our children's money, now, in the depth of this crisis, they're asking: Surely, we should be using this with a longer-term vision to accelerate the shift to a green economy, to prepare for aging, to deal with some of the inequalities which scar countries like this and the United States rather than just giving the money to the incumbents? And what people are beginning to ask is: Surely, just as we invest in R and D, two, three, four percent, of our GDP, of our economy, what if we put, let's say, one percent of public spending into social innovation, into elder care, new kinds of education, new ways of helping the disabled? It will become more involved in social investment, and social care and in industries where the value comes from what you do with others, not just from what you sell to them, and from relationships as well as from consumption. But this is one of those very rare moments when we have to choose whether we're just pedaling furiously to get back to where we were a year or two ago, and a very narrow idea of what the economy is for, or whether this is a moment to jump ahead, to reboot and to do some of the things we probably should have been doing anyway.","john avlon: people are asking: Surely we should be using this with a longer-term vision. avlon: we need to accelerate the shift to a green economy, to prepare for aging. avlon: we have to choose whether we're just pedaling furiously to get back to where we were a year ago.","As we reboot the world's economy, Geoff Mulgan poses a question: Instead of sending bailout money to doomed old industries, why not use stimulus funds to bootstrap some new, socially responsible companies -- and make the world a little bit better?"
495,"Now, cymatics is the process of visualizing sound by basically vibrating a medium such as sand or water, as you can see there. He created an experiment using a metal plate, covering it with sand and then bowing it to create the Chladni patterns that you see here on the right. As you can see with your own eyes. (Applause) So, what excites me about cymatics? Through the numerous ways that we can apply cymatics, we can actually start to unveil the substance of things not seen. Devices like the cymascope, which you can see here, have been used to scientifically observe cymatic patterns. This image here is created from a snippet of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony playing through a cymatic device. We can also use cymatics as a looking glass into nature. So, for example, here on the left we can see a snowflake as it would appear in nature. And if we kind of ponder on that, then perhaps cymatics had an influence on the formation of the universe itself.","cymatics is the process of visualizing sound by basically vibrating a medium such as sand or water. we can use cymatics as a looking glass into nature, for example, a snowflake.","Evan Grant demonstrates the science and art of cymatics, a process for making soundwaves visible.

496,"What I'd like to do first is take you through a very brief helicopter ride of stunts and the stunts industry in the movies and in television, and show you how technology has started to interface with the physical skills of the stunt performer in a way that makes the stunts bigger and actually makes them safer than they've ever been before. And that's in the up position. We used to have to drive up a ramp, and we still do sometimes. It's 30 feet. He did a jump from 100,000 feet, 102,000 to be precise, and he did it to test high altitude systems for military pilots in the new range of aircraft that were going up to 80,000 feet or so. Now one of the challenges of going up to altitude is when you get to 30,000 feet -- it's great, isn't it? So I've had to do quite a lot of training. This is what the view is going to be like at 90,000 feet for me. Trying to find a space suit to do this has led me to an area of technology that I never really expected when I set about doing this.

497,"So, having seen all of this in the course of a 30-year career, I was still a skeptic about climate change until about 10 years ago, because I thought the story of climate change was based on computer models. When I realized that climate change was real, and it was not based on computer models, I decided that one day I would do a project looking at trying to manifest climate change photographically. This is what one of our cameras saw over the course of a few months. We're going to be up there in just a few more weeks, and we expect that it's probably retreated another half a mile, but if I got there and discovered that it had collapsed and it was five miles further back, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised. Now it's really hard to grasp the scale of these places, because as the glaciers -- one of the things is that places like Alaska and Greenland are huge, they're not normal landscapes -- but as the glaciers are retreating, they're also deflating, like air is being let out of a balloon. That's what you see with these cameras. So that's where we started three years ago, way out on the left, and that's where we were a few months ago, the last time we went into Columbia. And here, if you watch, you can see the terminus retreating. The one glacier up in Greenland that puts more ice into the global ocean than all the other glaciers in the northern hemisphere combined is the Ilulissat Glacier. It's hard to get it.","glaciers retreat, deflate, like air is being let out of a balloon. one glacier up in Greenland puts more ice into the global ocean than all the other glaciers. photographer: ""we're going to be up there in just a few more weeks""","Photographer James Balog shares new image sequences from the Extreme Ice Survey, a network of time-lapse cameras recording glaciers receding at an alarming rate, some of the most vivid evidence yet of climate change."
498,"He could tell a story about an event, and so you felt you were absolutely there at the moment. Some people think that swimming is a very solo sport, you just dive into the sea and off you go. And I remember taking the goggles off my face and looking down at my hands in sheer shock, because my fingers had swollen so much that they were like sausages. And this dream which I had had ever since I was a young boy with my father, was just going out the window. And my close friend David, he saw the way I was thinking, and he came up to me and he said, ""Lewis, I've known you since you were 18 years old. I've known you, and I know, Lewis, deep down, right deep down here, that you are going to make this swim. Lewis, have the courage to go in there, because we are going to look after you every moment of it."" And I just, I got so much confidence from him saying that, because he knew me so well.

499,"So that's a problem in philosophy, but for today's purposes I'm going to assume that many people in this audience have a mind, and that I don't have to worry about this. Or to say, as Alan Greenspan did, ""I know you think you understand what you thought I said, but I'm not sure you realize that what you heard is not what I meant."" So first, the first thing I want to tell you is that there is a brain region in the human brain, in your brains, whose job it is to think about other people's thoughts. (Laughter) The second thing I want to say about this brain system is that although we human adults are really good at understanding other minds, we weren't always that way. Ivan comes back and he says, ""I want my cheese sandwich."" Child: I think he is going to take that one. RS: And Ivan says, ""I want my cheese sandwich."" (Laughter) And now what we've started to do in my lab is to put children into the brain scanner and ask what's going on in their brain as they develop this ability to think about other people's thoughts. So that's good, but of course what we'd rather is have a way to interfere with function in this brain region, and see if we could change people's moral judgment. But in the case of a failed attempt to harm, where Grace thought that it was poison, although it was really sugar, people now say it was more okay, she deserves less blame for putting the powder in the coffee.","a brain region in the human brain is whose job it is to think about other people's thoughts. child: we humans are really good at understanding other minds, but we weren't always that way. child: we've started to put children into the brain scanner and ask what's going on in their brains.","Sensing the motives and feelings of others is a natural talent for humans.
