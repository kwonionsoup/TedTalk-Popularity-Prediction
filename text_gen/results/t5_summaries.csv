0,"And when I started my blog, it was really this one goal -- I said, ""I am not going to be famous to the world, but I could be famous to people on the Internet."" Because the joke in this is that this person is not a tyrant, this person is so loving and so sweet that he lets me dress him up and post pictures of him to my blog. And we started with a slide of my Teds, and I had to add this slide, because I knew the minute I showed this, my mom -- my mom will see this, because she does read my blog and she'll say, ""Why wasn't there a picture of me?"" So, I have all the people that I know of. And to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs; to think about the people that are on those $100 computers, talking about who they are, sharing these personal stories -- this is an amazing thing. So I do something that's very narcissistic -- I am a blogger -- that is an amazing thing for me, because it captures a moment in time every day. And the last story I really want to tell is this story, because this is probably the one that means the most to me in all of what I'm doing. But the big thing that really influenced us was, her sister wrote to me, and she said -- and she wrote on this blog -- that writing her blog during the last couple of months of her life was probably the best thing that had happened to her, and being able to talk to people and to share what was going on, and being able to write and receive comments. And that was amazing, to be able to know that we had empowered that, and that blogging was something that she felt comfortable doing, and the idea that blogging doesn't have to be scary, that we don't always have to be attack of the blogs, that we can be people who are open, and wanting to help and talk to people. So, this is her legacy, and I think that my call to action to all of you is: think about blogs, think about what they are, think about what you've thought of them, and then actually do it, because it's something that's really going to change our lives.","bob greene: when i started my blog, i said, ""i am not going to be famous to the world, but I could be famous to people on the Internet"" he says my blog captures a moment in time every day. greene: blogging is something that's really going to change our lives.","The founding mother of the blog revolution, Movable Type's Mena Trott, talks about the early days of blogging, when she realized that giving regular people the power to share our lives online is the key to building a friendlier, more connected world."
1,"And I told it pretty much the same way I've just shared it with you: Tipper and I were driving ourselves, Shoney's, low-cost family restaurant chain, what the man said -- they laughed. And I thought to myself, in the middle of the night, in the middle of the Atlantic, what in the world could be wrong in Washington? (Laughter) But what it turned out to be, was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech, and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America. (Applause) Al Gore: I want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on: What can you do about the climate crisis? Cars and trucks -- I talked about that in the slideshow, but I want you to put it in perspective. OK. Now, what can you do? Those of you who are good at branding, I'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people. A lot more to be said about that. And so I'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse, in communities all across the country, and we're going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week, to keep it right on the cutting edge. This used to be a bipartisan issue, and I know that in this group it really is.","john avlon: i'm going to give a course this summer on branding. avlon: i'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people. he says it used to be a bipartisan issue, and in this group it really is. avlon: i'm going to give it en masse, in communities all across the country.","With the same humor and humanity he exuded in ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" Al Gore spells out 15 ways that individuals can address climate change immediately, from buying a hybrid to inventing a new, hotter brand name for global warming."

What do you do here?"" I'm like, ""You're a what?"" So, I'm going to show you an example of a company that does not have a tap counter. (Laughter) This is Microsoft Word. You do not.

3,"And the idea there is that outside the spaceship, the universe is implacably hostile, and inside is all we have, all we depend on, and we only get the one chance: if we mess up our spaceship, we've got nowhere else to go. Well, is this a typical place? All you've got to do is go a few hundred miles in that same direction and look back, and you won't see any walls or chemical scum at all -- all you see is a blue planet. And if you go further than that, you'll see the Sun, the solar system and the stars and so on, but that's still not typical of the universe, because stars come in galaxies. It's so dark, that if you were to be looking at the nearest star to you, and that star were to explode as a supernova, and you were to be staring directly at it at the moment when its light reached you, you still wouldn't be able to see even a glimmer. (Laughter) And yet, from intergalactic space, it's so far away you wouldn't even see it. Now, how do we know about an environment that's so far away and so different and so alien from anything we're used to? Now, that is knowledge. Well, again, it's dark out there to human senses, but all you've got to do is take a telescope, even one of present-day design, look out, and you'll see the same galaxies as we do from here. And if we want to be the exception to that, then logically, our only hope is to make use of the one feature that distinguishes our species and civilization from all the others, namely, our special relationship with the laws of physics, our ability to create new explanations, new knowledge -- to be a hub of existence.","if we mess up our spaceship, we've got nowhere else to go. if we mess up our spaceship, we've got nowhere else to go. if we mess up our spaceship, we've got nowhere else to go. if we mess up our spaceship, we've got nowhere else to go.","Legendary scientist David Deutsch puts theoretical physics on the back burner to discuss a more urgent matter: the survival of our species.

4,"I can't help but this wish: to think about when you're a little kid, and all your friends ask you, ""If a genie could give you one wish in the world, what would it be?"" But in 2003, when the war in Iraq was about to start, it was a very surreal feeling for me, because before the war started, there was kind of this media war that was going on. I didn't even have a camera at the time -- I had somebody bring it there, because I wanted to get access to Al Jazeera, George Bush's favorite channel, and a place which I was very curious about because it's disliked by many governments across the Arab world, and also called the mouthpiece of Osama Bin Laden by some people in the US government. So, the impact that had on me -- me realizing that I just saw people on the other side, and those people in the Al Jazeera office must have felt the way I was feeling that night, and it upset me on a profound level that I wasn't as bothered as much the night before. You know, we're criticized abroad for believing we're the saviors of the world in some way, but the flip side of it is that, actually, when people do see what is happening abroad and people's reactions to some of our policy abroad, we feel this power, that we need to -- we feel like we have to get the power to change things. But I know the power of it, I know that it starts people thinking about how to change the world. And that's what this is about. There's Working Films and there's Current TV, which is an incredible platform for people around the world to be able to put their -- (Applause) Yeah, it's amazing. I know that it's very intangible, touching people's hearts and souls, but the only way that I know how to do it, the only way that I know how to reach out to somebody's heart and soul all across the world, is by showing them a film. But it would be the day that the world comes together through film, the power of film.","john avlon: if a genie could give you one wish in the world, what would it be? avlon: it would be the day that the world comes together through film, the power of film. he says working films and current television are an incredible platform for people. avlon: it would be the day that the world comes together through film.",Jehane Noujaim unveils her 2006 TED Prize wish: to bring the world together for one day a year through the power of film.
5,"And so I want to tell you about that first, and then go on into where I think love is going. You can list what you don't like about them, but then you sweep that aside and focus on what you do. It would be nice to go to bed with them, but you want them to call you on the telephone, to invite you out, etc., to tell you that they love you. And in fact, I think it's more powerful than the sex drive. I'll say just a couple of things, and then go on to sex and love. I don't know why they want to think that men and women are alike. And I say, ""Who do you think these men are sleeping with?"" People around the world, in a study of 37 societies, want to be in love with the person that they marry. Dopamine's associated with romantic love, and you can just fall in love with somebody who you're just having casual sex with.

6,"It began with a conversation with a woman. I think if you had told me when I was younger that I was going to grow up, and be in shoe stores, and people would scream out, ""There she is, the Vagina Lady!"" (Laughter) But I want to talk a little bit about happiness, and the relationship to this whole vagina journey, because it has been an extraordinary journey that began eight years ago. I think what I learned from talking about the vagina and speaking about the vagina, is it was the most obvious thing -- it was right in the center of my body and the center of the world -- and yet it was the one thing nobody talked about. What I have learned is two things: one, that the epidemic of violence towards women is shocking; it's global; it is so profound and it is so devastating, and it is so in every little pocket of every little crater, of every little society that we don't even recognize it, because it's become ordinary. What has also happened is in the course of these travels -- and it's been an extraordinary thing -- is that every single place that I have gone to in the world, I have met a new species. (Laughter) But one of the things I've seen is this species -- and it is a species, and it is a new paradigm, and it doesn't get reported in the press or in the media because I don't think good news ever is news, and I don't think people who are transforming the planet are what gets the ratings on TV shows. And it's been really interesting to be in my head for the last two days; I've been very disoriented -- (Laughter) because I think the world, the V-world, is very much in your body. And she came, and she witnessed this, and she decided that she would go back and leave her husband, and that she would bring V-Day to Guatemala. And he had shown up, obviously, in a form that it took me a long time to understand, which is that when we give in the world what we want the most, we heal the broken part inside each of us.","the epidemic of violence towards women is shocking; it's global, says nadine dos santos. dos santos: every single place that i've gone to in the world, I have met a new species. she says if we give in the world what we want most, we heal the broken part inside each of us. dos santos: if we give in the world what we want the most, we heal the broken part inside us","Eve Ensler, creator of ""The Vagina Monologues,"" shares how a discussion about menopause with her friends led to talking about all sorts of sexual acts onstage, waging a global campaign to end violence toward women and finding her own happiness."
7,"And that was: What is the purpose of this? And then when I wrote this book, and all of a sudden, it just took off, and I started saying, now, what's the purpose of this? I just don't believe that. And when you write a book that the first sentence of the book is, ""It's not about you,"" then, when all of a sudden it becomes the best-selling book in history, you've got to figure, well, I guess it's not about me. And I'm going, what do I do with this? And I gave it back because I didn't want anybody thinking that I do what I do for money -- I don't. And as I read that, I looked at it, and I thought, you know, what this is saying is that the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence. You know, there's a story in the Bible about Moses, whether you believe it's true or not, it really doesn't matter to me. I just, this is why I love what Michael does, because it's like, if he's debunking it, then I don't have to.

8,"It is in this spirit that I join into a discussion of one of the critical issues of our time, namely, how to mobilize different forms of capital for the project of state building. But we are not dealing with the implications of the one world that we are living in. And that is that if we want to have one world, this one world cannot be based on huge pockets of exclusion, and then inclusion for some. Now, the issue that should concern us here -- and that's the challenge that I would like to pose to this group -- is again, it takes 16 years in your countries to produce somebody with a B.S. And I hope that this group would be able to deal with the issue of state and development and the empowerment of the majority of the world's poor, through this means. But we have to understand that we've been incredibly lucky. You know, when I went back in December of 2001, I had absolutely no desire to work with the Afghan government because I'd lived as a nationalist. And what I will say here is that aid doesn't work.

But if you are, and you say to somebody, you know, they say, ""What do you do?"" (Applause) That was it, by the way. We were sitting there, and I think they just went out of sequence, because we talked to the little boy afterward and said, ""You OK with that?"" I was. Isn't it? (Laughter) Don't they?

10,"On September 10, the morning of my seventh birthday, I came downstairs to the kitchen, where my mother was washing the dishes and my father was reading the paper or something, and I sort of presented myself to them in the doorway, and they said, ""Hey, happy birthday!"" And he said, ""So?"" And I said, ""So? (Laughter) Now, I didn't know it at the time, but I really wasn't turning seven on September 10th.

Now, I was raised in the Pacific Northwest, around a lot of Church of Latter-day Saints people and, you know, I've worked with them and even dated them, but I never really knew the doctrine, or what they said to people when they were out on a mission, and I guess I was sort of curious, so I said, ""Well, please, come in."" And they said, ""Well, then we have a story to tell you."" And I said, ""No, I don't,"" because I was sort of upset about this Lamanite story and this crazy gold plate story, but the truth was, I hadn't really thought this through, so I backpedaled a little and I said, ""Well, what exactly do you mean by 'righteous'?

So you're not just doing a building for the residents or for the people who are going to use it, but for the community as a whole. And I didn't know what I was doing -- like I said, mid-20s -- and I'm the Internet generation, so we started a website. (Laughter) So what you don't know is, we've got these thousands of designers working around the world, connected basically by a website, and we have a staff of three. The idea is it's not just a clinic, it's a community center. They said, this is our design, because it's not only about engaging a community; it's about empowering a community, and about getting them to be a part of the rebuilding process. And what that means is we actually live and work with the community, and they're part of the design process. Because you know what? So it's going to take a lot of computing power, because I want the idea that any laptop anywhere in the world can plug into the system and be able to not only participate in developing these designs, but utilize the designs. And so, you know, I want these -- I just should note: I have two laptops and one of them is there, and that has 3000 designs on it.","cnn's richard quest started a website that connects thousands of designers around the world. quest: it's not just a clinic, it's a community center. he says it's going to take a lot of computing power. quest: it's going to take a lot of computing power.","Accepting his 2006 TED Prize, Cameron Sinclair demonstrates how passionate designers and architects can respond to world housing crises.

12,"But the students are not there. (Laughter) This is where I realized that there was really a need to communicate, because the data of what's happening in the world and the child health of every country is very well aware. Can you see there? But in the middle, we have most of the world population, and they have now 24 percent of the income. And you have the OECD there, and you have sub-Saharan Africa there, and we take off the Arab states there, coming both from Africa and from Asia, and we put them separately, and we can expand this axis, and I can give it a new dimension here, by adding the social values there, child survival. And if we move back again, here, and we put trails on them, like this, you can see again that the speed of development is very, very different, and the countries are moving more or less at the same rate as money and health, but it seems you can move much faster if you are healthy first than if you are wealthy first. Now, this is, more or less, if you look at the average data of the countries -- they are like this. So if I go and look here, we can see that Uganda today is where South Korea was in 1960. But this is what we would like to see, isn't it? These countries are lifting more than the economy, and it will be very interesting to follow this over the year, as I would like you to be able to do with all the publicly funded data.","most of the world population has now 24 percent of the income. but the speed of development is very, very different. it seems you can move much faster if you are healthy first than if you are wealthy first.","You've never seen data presented like this.

13,"You don't do book talks at TED, but I'm going to have just one slide about my book, because there is one message in it which I think this group really needs to hear. They don't have to be. It doesn't have to be. And there was a passage in it which he did not present here and I think it is so good, I'm going to read it to you: ""Over billions of years on a unique sphere, chance has painted a thin covering of life: complex, improbable, wonderful and fragile. And what I want to do now is say a bit about this book from the design standpoint, because I think it's actually a brilliant book. This is the evolution of religion that's been going on for thousands of years, and he's just the latest brilliant practitioner of it. We don't need a belief in God to be good or to have meaning in us. I'm afraid that a lot of people take that sentiment to mean that we don't have to do the sorts of things that Al Gore is trying so hard to get us to do. And what I find deeply troubling in this book is that he seems to be arguing that if you want to be moral, if you want to have meaning in your life, you have to be an Intelligent Designer, you have to deny the theory of evolution by natural selection. I don't believe it and I think this idea, popular as it is -- not in this guise, but in general -- is itself one of the main problems that we face.","john avlon: al gore's book on evolution is a brilliant example of evolution. avlon: we don't need a belief in God to be good or to have meaning in us. avlon: if you want to be moral, if you want to have meaning in your life, you have to be an Intelligent Designer.","Philosopher Dan Dennett calls for religion -- all religion -- to be taught in schools, so we can understand its nature as a natural phenomenon.

(Laughter) We all know what's good about it, so I'm going to talk about what's bad about it. The second effect is that, even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice, we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from. One of them is, with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from, if you buy one and it's not perfect -- and what salad dressing is? All this choice made it possible for me to do better. There are lots of places in the world, and we have heard about several of them, where their problem is not that they have too much choice. Because the truth of the matter is, if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible, you don't have freedom.","bob greene: when you wake up in the morning, you have to decide what kind of person you want to be. greene: even if we overcome the paralysis and make a choice, we end up less satisfied. he says there are lots of places in the world where their problem is not that they have too much choice. greene: if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible, you don't have freedom.","Psychologist Barry Schwartz takes aim at a central tenet of western societies: freedom of choice.

By pulling a string, it vibrates and produces a sound wave, which passes through a piece of wood called a bridge, and goes down to the wood box and gets amplified, but ... let me think. (Laughter) OK, this is sort of technology, but I can call it a 16th-century technology. (Laughter) The violin is very beautiful.

You know, like that. What's really interesting here is what you can do with it and the kind of interfaces you can build on top of it.

And if you remember one thing from what I want to talk about today, it's that the only way to end poverty, to make it history, is to build viable systems on the ground that deliver critical and affordable goods and services to the poor, in ways that are financially sustainable and scaleable. And I want to talk a little bit about that, and some of the examples, so you can see what it is that we're doing. That's who we talk about when we think about ""the poor."" One is in India, where there are 240 million farmers, most of whom make less than two dollars a day. On the distribution side, though, as a world, we have a lot of work to do. And so, when I told her about our idea -- that maybe we could take a Tupperware model from the United States, and find a way for the women themselves to go out and sell these nets to others -- she quickly started calculating what she herself could make and signed up. She brought 10 of the women with whom she interacts together to see if she could sell these nets, five dollars apiece, despite the fact that people say nobody will buy one, and we learned a lot about how you sell things. And we've started making curtains, and not only is it beautiful, but people can see status -- that you care about your children. And so I urge all of you to think next time as to how to engage with this notion and this opportunity that we all have -- to make poverty history -- by really becoming part of the process and moving away from an us-and-them world, and realizing that it's about all of us, and the kind of world that we, together, want to live in and share.",john avlon: only way to end poverty is to build viable systems on the ground. avlon: 240 million farmers in india make less than two dollars a day. avlon: we need to build systems that deliver critical and affordable goods to the poor. avlon: we need to make poverty history by really becoming part of the process.,"Jacqueline Novogratz applauds the world's heightened interest in Africa and poverty, but argues persuasively for a new approach."

20,"And so we're going to have to do a lot of work that goes beyond just the Internet. And the reason for this is that most people understand the need for neutrality. So how do we do this? The reason for this is if we say we're only going to write the ""truth"" about some topic, that doesn't do us a damn bit of good of figuring out what to write, because I don't agree with you about what's the truth. So this neutrality policy is really important for us because it empowers a community that is very diverse to come together and actually get some work done. This is really important because a lot of new pages are just garbage that has to be deleted, you know, ""ASDFASDF."" Is it what? So as an example of how this can be important: we recently had a situation where a neo-Nazi website discovered Wikipedia, and they said, ""Oh, well, this is horrible, this Jewish conspiracy of a website, and we're going to get certain articles deleted that we don't like. And we see they have a voting process, so we're going to send -- we have 40,000 members and we're going to send them over and they're all going to vote and get these pages deleted.""

21,"I'm Rich Baraniuk and what I'd like to talk a little bit about today are some ideas that I think have just tremendous resonance with all the things that have been talked about the last two days. But I'm not here to talk about music today. So, that's what I'd like to talk about and, really, how we get from where we are now to where we need to go. Imagine making it free, so that anyone in the world can have access to all of this knowledge, and imagine using information technology so that you can update this content, improve it, play with it, on a timescale that's more on the order of seconds instead of years. Over the last six-and-a-half years, we've been working really hard at Rice University on a project called Connexions, and so what I'd like to do for the rest of the talk is just tell you a little bit about what people are doing with Connexions, which you can kind of think of as the counterpoint to Nicholas Negroponte's talk yesterday, where they're working on the hardware of bringing education to the world. And to them, this idea of being able to remix and customize to the local context is extraordinarily important, because just providing free content to people has actually been likened by people in the developing world to a kind of cultural imperialism -- that if you don't empower people with the ability to re-contextualize the material, translate it into their own language and take ownership of it, it's not good. And I think that really, in a sense, what we're trying to do is make Minsky's dream come to a reality, where you can imagine all the books in a library actually starting to talk to each other. So, what we have to do is get it right from the very beginning. In fact, you're free to share it, to do all of these things: to copy it, to change it, even to make commercial use of it, as long as you attribute the author. All of you here are tremendously imbued with tremendous amounts of knowledge, and what I'd like to do is invite each and every one of you to contribute to this project and other projects of its type, because I think together we can truly change the landscape of education and educational publishing.",rich baraniuk: connexions is a project that aims to bring education to the world. he says it's a counterpoint to n. negroponte's talk on cultural imperialism. baraniuk: we need to empower people to re-contextualize the material.,"In 2006, open-learning visionary Richard Baraniuk explains the vision behind Connexions (now called OpenStax), an open-source, online education system.

22,"And that's why we have to really talk about this a lot -- evangelize, I will go so far as to say, quite a lot -- in order to get people's attention, and make people realize that they are in a trance in this regard. So that's all I'm going to say about that. So we can put it this way: we can say that, you know, we have this chain of events. Because, you know, most people, when they hear that I predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to 1,000 or more, they think that I'm saying that we're going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are so thoroughly eliminating aging that those therapies will let us live to 1,000 or more. If you're already 100, or even if you're 80 -- and an average 80-year-old, we probably can't do a lot for you with these therapies, because you're too close to death's door for the really initial, experimental therapies to be good enough for you. So this is a genuine conclusion that I come to, that the first 150-year-old -- we don't know how old that person is today, because we don't know how long it's going to take to get these first-generation therapies. And this is what it is. So, these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago and that is pretty good news, because it means that, you know, we've come a long way in biology in these 20 years, so the fact that we haven't extended this list is a pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done. I haven't got time to go through them at all, but my conclusion is that, if we can actually get suitable funding for this, then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only 10 years, but we do need to get serious about it. And I think we know how to do it.","aaron carroll: gerontologists say we're going to invent therapies that eliminate aging. carroll: we don't know how old that person is today, but we don't know how long it will take. he says we can develop robust mouse rejuvenation in 10 years, but we need to get serious. carroll: if we can get funding for this, we can probably develop mouse rejuvenation in 10 years.","Cambridge researcher Aubrey de Grey argues that aging is merely a disease -- and a curable one at that.

This is the most important slide that I've ever seen in public health, [Sovereigns killed by smallpox] because it shows you to be the richest and the strongest, and to be kings and queens of the world, did not protect you from dying of smallpox. There are 20 million people on the road at any time, in buses and trains, walking; 500,000 villages, 120 million households, and none of them wanted to report if they had a case of smallpox in their house, because they thought that smallpox was the visitation of a deity, Shitala Mata, the cooling mother, and it was wrong to bring strangers into your house when the deity was in the house. When we didn't search, we had the illusion that there was no disease. Now, if we had an ""undo"" button, and we could go back and isolate it and grab it when it first started -- if we could find it early, and we had early detection and early response, and we could put each one of those viruses in jail -- that's the only way to deal with something like a pandemic. And that simulation that I showed you that you thought was bird flu -- that was SARS.

25,"What I'm going to tell you today is that, in fact, based on 10 years of research, a unique opportunity to go inside a gang -- to see the actual books, the financial records of the gang -- that the answer turns out not to be that being in the gang was a glamorous life. And then third, I want to tell you, in a very superficial way, about some of the things we found when we actually got to look at the financial records, the books, of the gang. To do that, you have to actually go back to a time before crack cocaine, in the early '80s, and look at it from the perspective of a gang leader. But the thing is, there was no money in it. I don't have time to talk about it today, but if you think about it, I would say that in the last 25 years, of every invention or innovation that's occurred in this country, the biggest one in terms of impact on the well-being of people who live in the inner city, was crack cocaine. And it turned out there was this audience that didn't know it wanted crack cocaine, but when it came, it really did. And for the people who were there running the gang, it was a great way, seemingly, to make a lot of money. So if I have to kind of summarize very quickly in the short time I have what the bottom line of what I take away from the gang is, it's that, if I had to draw a parallel between the gang and any other organization, it would be that the gang is just like McDonald's, in a lot of different respects -- the restaurant McDonald's. So in some sense, the foot soldiers are a lot like the people who are taking your order at McDonald's, and it's not just by chance that they're like them. Let me do one last thing I hadn't thought I'd have time to do, which is to talk about what we learned more generally about economics, from the study of the gang.","bob greene: 10 years of research shows that crack cocaine was a great way to make money. he says the gang is just like McDonald's, in a lot of different respects. greene: if you had to draw a parallel, it would be that the gang is just like the restaurant McDonald's.","""Freakonomics"" author Steven Levitt presents new data on the finances of drug dealing.

26,"But if you look, if you have that perspective, then you can see what happened in the last 60 years. And if you agree with that, then I think the best way to improve these countries is to recognize that economic development is of the people, by the people, for the people. The question was, how much did it cost to install a new telephone in Bangladesh? I mean, in America, people buy cars, and they put very little money down. They get a car, and they go to work. In the United States, we have -- everybody needs a banking service, but very few of us are trying to buy a bank. So we could do that for telephones. I mean, of course there might be other good reasons, but this was one of the reasons -- they had to be. What is it that they really do?

35,"So, if the body is sensing that you have damage to an organ and then it's initiating cancer, it's almost as if this is a repair response. If somehow we can cause these cells to differentiate -- to become bone tissue, lung tissue, liver tissue, whatever that cancer has been put there to do -- it would be a repair process. But it struck me that I'd never heard of cancer of the heart, or cancer of any skeletal muscle for that matter. And so at first I kind of thought, ""Well, maybe there's some obvious explanation why skeletal muscle doesn't get cancer -- at least not that I know of."" Some of my hypotheses are that when you first think about skeletal muscle, there's a lot of blood vessels going to skeletal muscle. And one article that really stood out to me when I was just reading about this, trying to figure out why cancer doesn't go to skeletal muscle, was that it had reported 16 percent of micro-metastases to skeletal muscle upon autopsy. So this suggests that maybe if there is an anti-angiogenic factor in skeletal muscle -- or perhaps even more, an angiogenic routing factor, so it can actually direct where the blood vessels grow -- this could be a potential future therapy for cancer. Now, one thing that kind of ties the resistance of skeletal muscle to cancer -- to the cancer as a repair response gone out of control in the body -- is that skeletal muscle has a factor in it called ""MyoD."" So, is it possible that the tumor cells are going to the skeletal muscle tissue, but once in contact inside the skeletal muscle tissue, MyoD acts upon these tumor cells and causes them to become skeletal muscle cells? Maybe tumor cells are being disguised as skeletal muscle cells, and this is why it seems as if it is so rare.","skeletal muscle has a factor called ""MyoD,"" which acts upon tumor cells. tumor cells are going to the skeletal muscle tissue, but MyoD causes them to become skeletal muscle cells. if tumor cells are going to the skeletal muscle tissue, MyoD causes them to become skeletal muscle cells.",Eva Vertes -- only 19 when she gave this talk -- discusses her journey toward studying medicine and her drive to understand the roots of cancer and Alzheimer’s.

They're faster, so you've got exponential growth in the speed of transistors, so the cost of a cycle of one transistor has been coming down with a halving rate of 1.1 years. And it's not just computers. Once we understand its principles of operation, and the pace with which we are reverse-engineering biology is accelerating, we can actually design these things to be thousands of times more capable. There's actually one going into human trial, so this is feasible technology. This is at an early stage, but you can show with the exponential growth of the amount of information about the brain and the exponential improvement in the resolution of brain scanning, we will succeed in reverse-engineering the human brain by the 2020s. Wall Street noticed that this was a revolutionary technology, which it was, but then six months later, when it hadn't revolutionized all business models, they figured, well, that was wrong, and then we had this bust. We'll have completed the reverse-engineering of the human brain, 1,000 dollars of computing will be far more powerful than the human brain in terms of basic raw capacity.

39,"But I think the most important one is that London was this city of 2.5 million people, and it was the largest city on the face of the planet at that point. So what ended up happening, actually, is they ended up increasing the outbreaks of cholera because, as we now know, cholera is actually in the water. So this was the state of London in 1854, and in the middle of all this carnage and offensive conditions, and in the midst of all this scientific confusion about what was actually killing people, it was a very talented classic 19th century multi-disciplinarian named John Snow, who was a local doctor in Soho in London, who had been arguing for about four or five years that cholera was, in fact, a waterborne disease, and had basically convinced nobody of this. Snow lived near there, heard about the outbreak, and in this amazing act of courage went directly into the belly of the beast because he thought an outbreak that concentrated could actually potentially end up convincing people that, in fact, the real menace of cholera was in the water supply and not in the air. And he thought about representing that as a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods, people who hadn't, you know, percentages of people who hadn't, but eventually he hit upon the idea that what he needed was something that you could see. And so, with the help of this map, and with the help of more evangelizing that he did over the next few years and that Whitehead did, eventually, actually, the authorities slowly started to come around. It took much longer than sometimes we like to think in this story, but by 1866, when the next big cholera outbreak came to London, the authorities had been convinced -- in part because of this story, in part because of this map -- that in fact the water was the problem. When people were looking at 10 percent of their neighborhoods dying in the space of seven days, there was a widespread consensus that this couldn't go on, that people weren't meant to live in cities of 2.5 million people. But because of what Snow did, because of this map, because of the whole series of reforms that happened in the wake of this map, we now take for granted that cities have 10 million people, cities like this one are in fact sustainable things. We don't worry that New York City is going to collapse in on itself quite the way that, you know, Rome did, and be 10 percent of its size in 100 years or 200 years.","cholera outbreaks in london increased because cholera is actually in the water. cholera is a waterborne disease, but it's not in the air, says dr. sanjay gupta. gupta: we don't have to worry about cholera outbreaks in cities of 2.5 million people.","Author Steven Johnson takes us on a 10-minute tour of The Ghost Map, his book about a cholera outbreak in 1854 London and the impact it had on science, cities and modern society."

When the terrorist incidents occurred in the United Kingdom a couple of years ago, I think even though they didn't claim as many lives as we lost in the United States on 9/11, I think the thing that troubled the British most was that the perpetrators were not invaders, but homegrown citizens whose religious and political identities were more important to them than the people they grew up with, went to school with, worked with, shared weekends with, shared meals with. When I organized my foundation, and I thought about the world as it is and the world that I hope to leave to the next generation, and I tried to be realistic about what I had cared about all my life that I could still have an impact on. (Applause) When I got out of office and was asked to work, first in the Caribbean, to try to help deal with the AIDS crisis, generic drugs were available for about 500 dollars a person a year. Now we can get it for about 100 dollars. So what we have been trying to do, working first in Rwanda and then in Malawi and other places -- but I want to talk about Rwanda tonight -- is to develop a model for rural health care in a very poor area that can be used to deal with AIDS, TB, malaria, other infectious diseases, maternal and child health, and a whole range of health issues poor people are grappling with in the developing world, that can first be scaled for the whole nation of Rwanda, and then will be a model that could literally be implemented in any other poor country in the world. The person, in my view, who has done the best job of this in the health care area, of building a system in a very poor area, is Dr. Paul Farmer, who, many of you know, has worked for now 20 years with his group, Partners in Health, primarily in Haiti where he started, but they've also worked in Russia, in Peru and other places around the world. Because it seemed to me if we could prove there was a model in Haiti and a model in Rwanda that we could then take all over the country, number one, it would be a wonderful thing for a country that has suffered as much as any on Earth in the last 15 years, and number two, we would have something that could then be adapted to any other poor country anywhere in the world.

42,"The second school I was at had big trees too, had a fantastic tulip tree, I think it was the biggest in the country, and it also had a lot of wonderful bushes and vegetation around it, around the playing fields. And 30 years later I was sitting in an airplane, next to a lady called Veronica, who came from Chile, and we were on a human rights tour, and she was starting to tell me what it was like to be tortured, and, from my very privileged position, this was the only reference point that I had. And it was an amazing learning experience because, for me, human rights have been something in which I had, you know, a part-time interest, but, mainly, it was something that happened to other people over there. But I got a phone call from Bono in 1985 and, as you know, he's a great singer, but he's a magnificent hustler, and -- (Laughter) -- a very hard guy to say no to, and he was saying, you know, just after I'd done the Biko song, we're going to do a tour for Amnesty, you have to be on it, and really that was the first time that I'd been out and started meeting people who'd watched their family being shot in front of them, who'd had a partner thrown out of an airplane into an ocean, and suddenly this world of human rights arrived in my world, and I couldn't really walk away in quite the same way as before. And Reebok set up a foundation after these Human Rights Now tours and there was a decision then -- well, we made a proposal, for a couple of years, about trying to set up a division that was going to give cameras to human rights activists. (Music) Woman: Life in the camp is never simple. Anyway, WITNESS has been trying to arm the brave people who often put their lives at risk around the world, with cameras, and I'd like to show you just a little more of that. And we've also been trying to get computers out to the world, so that groups can communicate much more effectively, campaign much more effectively, but now we have the wonderful possibility, which is given to us from the mobile phone with the camera in it, because that is cheap; it's ubiquitous; and it's moving fast all around the world -- and it's very exciting for us. And so, the dream is that we could have a world in which anyone who has anything bad happen to them of this sort has a chance of getting their story uploaded, being seen, being watched, that they really know that they can be heard, that there would be a giant website, maybe, a little like Google Earth, and you could fly over and find out the realities of what's going, for the world's inhabitants. In a way what this technology is allowing is, really, that a lot of the problems of the world can have a human face, that we can actually see who's dying of AIDS or who's being beaten up, for the first time, and we can hear their stories in a way that the blogger culture -- if we can move that into these sort of fields, I think we can really transform the world in all sorts of ways.",cnn's nina dos santos was on a human rights tour 30 years ago. she met people who'd watched their family being shot in front of them. now she's trying to arm the brave people who often put their lives at risk.,Musician and activist Peter Gabriel shares his very personal motivation for standing up for human rights with the watchdog group WITNESS -- and tells stories of citizen journalists in action.

And then with four screws, we put in a frame, then we snap in the device and we run with wires -- the one shown in green will go to the surface of the brain with electrodes, to the epileptic focus, the origin of the epilepsy, where we can sense the electrical signal and have computer analysis that tells us when to hit it with some electrical current to prevent the clinical manifestation of the seizure.","30 million americans have migraine headaches, and we need a means to treat it.

And maybe it's something that people in Oxford don't do very often, but if you ever make it to the sea, and you swallow a mouthful of seawater, keep in mind that each milliliter has about a million bacteria and on the order of 10 million viruses. We just take seawater and we filter it, and we collect different size organisms on different filters, and then take their DNA back to our lab in Rockville, where we can sequence a hundred million letters of the genetic code every 24 hours. Just to try and get an assessment of what our gene repertoire was, we assembled all the data -- including all of ours thus far from the expedition, which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet -- and it totaled around 29 million genes. Of those roughly 29 million genes, we only have around 24,000 in our genome. So we made a map of all the genes that could take transposon insertions and we called those ""non-essential genes."" But it turns out the environment is very critical for this, and you can only define an essential or non-essential gene based on exactly what's in the environment. The only way to prove these ideas was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them, and we had to do this in a cassette-based fashion.

So this is the list, and this is the one I'd like to share with you. And just to give you a sense of reference, the U.N. actually estimate that for half that amount, for about 75 billion dollars a year, we could solve all major basic problems in the world. It's not to say that if we had all the money in the world, we wouldn't want to do it. Again, what this does and what it focuses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV/AIDS. To start thinking about saying, ""Let's do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost, not the things that we don't know how to do, but let's do the great things where we can do an enormous amount of good, at very low cost, right now."" At the end of the day, you can disagree with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these, but we have to be honest and frank about saying, if there's some things we do, there are other things we don't do.","john avlon: if we don't do all things, we have to ask ourselves, which ones should we solve first? avlon: if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first, you can't ask either of them. avlon: we have to be honest and frank about saying, if there's some things we do, there are other things we don't do.","Given $50 billion to spend, which would you solve first, AIDS or global warming?

53,"If we were to wipe out insects alone, just that group alone, on this planet -- which we are trying hard to do -- the rest of life and humanity with it would mostly disappear from the land. By my college years, I was a devoted myrmecologist, a specialist on the biology of ants, but my attention and research continued to make journeys across the great variety of life on Earth in general -- including all that it means to us as a species, how little we understand it and how pressing a danger that our activities have created for it. About 16,000 species of nematode worms have been discovered and diagnosed by scientists; there could be hundreds of thousands of them, even millions, still unknown. They've had billions of years to do it, but especially during the earliest period of biological evolution on this planet. For example, even in the United States, the 200,000 species known currently actually has been found to be only partial in coverage; it is mostly unknown to us in basic biology. We urgently need to change this. We need to have the biosphere properly explored so that we can understand and competently manage it. What is the ""Encyclopedia of Life?"" And most of all, it can inspire a new generation of biologists to continue the quest that started, for me personally, 60 years ago: to search for life, to understand it and finally, above all, to preserve it. That is my wish.","about 16,000 species of nematode worms have been discovered and diagnosed by scientists. about 200,000 species known currently has been found to be only partial in coverage.

54,"This is me. We were just over 200 miles left to go to the Pole, and we'd run out of time. My mum was there; my brother was there; my granddad was there -- had a little Union Jack -- (Laughter) -- and that was about it. This time, I wanted to go right across, on my own this time, from Russia, at the top of the map, to the North Pole, where the sort of kink in the middle is, and then on to Canada. I think the joke is that Khatanga isn't the end of the world, but you can see it from there. I got up in the morning, took the tent down, skied north for seven-and-a-half hours, put the tent up, and I was two and a half miles further back than when I'd started. It took me 68 days to get there from Russia, and there is nothing there. There isn't even a pole at the Pole. This was the last day I had on the ice.

And the official truth, the truth was, the law was, that a black man was a property, was a thing, you see. But since this was called ""risk taking,"" I'm doing somebody who I never do, because she's so unlikeable that one person actually came backstage and told me to take her out of the show she was in. I didn't even want to accept the fact that she was dead, so I went in and I put a mirror to her mouth -- there was no thing, nothing, coming out of her mouth. So we went to the mall and we told a police that we had, like, lost her, that she was missing. And I told you that in -- you know, I didn't give you the year, but in '79 I thought that I was going to go around and find bull riders and pig farmers and people like that, and I got sidetracked on race relations.

56,"Now, this sounds like an intrinsically upbeat worldview in a way, because when you think of non-zero, you think win-win, you know, that's good. I kind of think this is a kind of a business-class morality. And by that I mean, if people in the Muslim world get more hateful, more resentful, less happy with their place in the world, it'll be bad for the West. That's what's responsible for this growth of this moral progress so far, and I'm saying we once again have a correlation of fortunes, and if people respond to it intelligently, we will see the development of tolerance and so on -- the norms that we need, you know. So, these two things, you know, if they get people's attention and drive home the positive correlation and people do what's in their self-interests, which is further the moral evolution, then they could actually have a constructive effect. It's especially hard to do when people hate you, OK, because you don't really, in a sense, want to completely understand why people hate you. (Laughter) You don't want to say, ""Well, yeah, I can kind of understand how a human being in those circumstances would hate the country I live in."" That's not a pleasant thing, but I think it's something that we're going to have to get used to and work on. Now, I want to stress that to understand, you know -- there are people who don't like this whole business of understanding the grassroots, the root causes of things; they don't want to know why people hate us. Now, social organization has reached the global level, and I guess, if there's good news I can say I'm bringing you, it's just that all the salvation of the world requires is the intelligent pursuit of self-interests in a disciplined and careful way.","if people get more hateful, more resentful, less happy with their place in the world, it'll be bad for the west. if people respond to it intelligently, we will see the development of tolerance and so on. if people do what's in their self-interests, then they could have a constructive effect.","Author Robert Wright explains ""non-zero-sumness"" -- the network of linked fortunes and cooperation that has guided our evolution to this point -- and how we can use it to help save humanity today."
57,"Brilliant later today -- I want to talk about the other pandemic, which is cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension -- all of which are completely preventable for at least 95 percent of people just by changing diet and lifestyle. We showed a few months ago -- we published the first study showing you can actually stop or reverse the progression of prostate cancer by making changes in diet and lifestyle, and 70 percent regression in the tumor growth, or inhibition of the tumor growth, compared to only nine percent in the control group. Now there is an epidemic of obesity: two-thirds of adults and 15 percent of kids. What's really concerning to me is that diabetes has increased 70 percent in the past 10 years, and this may be the first generation in which our kids live a shorter life span than we do. That's pitiful, and it's preventable. Now these are not election returns, these are the people -- the number of the people who are obese by state, beginning in '85, '86, '87 -- these are from the CDC website -- '88, '89, '90, '91 -- you get a new category -- '92, '93, '94, '95, '96, '97, '98, '99, 2000, 2001 -- it gets worse. But the people in Asia are starting to eat like we are, which is why they're starting to get sick like we are. They can make it fun and sexy and hip and crunchy and convenient to eat healthier foods, like -- I chair the advisory boards to McDonald's, and PepsiCo, and ConAgra, and Safeway, and soon Del Monte, and they're finding that it's good business. The salads that you see at McDonald's came from the work -- they're going to have an Asian salad. And so if we can do that, then we can free up resources for buying drugs that you really do need for treating AIDS and HIV and malaria and for preventing avian flu.","cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension are preventable for 95 percent of people. we can stop or reverse the progression of prostate cancer by changing diet and lifestyle. two-thirds of adults and 15 percent of kids are obese.",Forget the latest disease in the news: Cardiovascular disease kills more people than everything else combined -- and it’s mostly preventable.

59,"And when I met her, she had just taken a walk over the Himalayas from Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, into Nepal, across to India -- 30 days -- to meet her leader, the Dalai Lama. And it really impressed me -- I met him two weeks after he got out of prison -- that he went through that experience, and ended up with the demeanor that he had. And this is -- well, at the time -- I did this 10 years ago -- that was 36 years after the Dalai Lama had left. As a teenager, he faced the invasion of his country, and had to deal with it -- he was the leader of the country. And we spent -- I was with a team -- two weeks with these guys out in the jungle watching them hunt. And I was -- I usually travel alone when I do my work, but I did this -- I hosted a program for Discovery, and when I went down with the team, I was quite concerned about going in with a whole bunch of people, especially into the Huaorani, deep into the Huaorani tribe. So, one thing we did five years ago: we started a program that links kids in indigenous communities with kids in the United States. And the way we do it is, we do it in workshops, and we bring people who want to learn digital workflow and storytelling, and have them work with the kids. This is all their movies. And this kid lived in the village -- he wasn't there at the time -- and this is the little movie he put together about that.","10 years ago, i met the Dalai Lama, who faced the invasion of his country. i hosted a program that links kids in indigenous communities with kids in the u.s. five years ago, we started a program that links kids in indigenous communities with kids in the u.s.","Photographer Phil Borges shows rarely seen images of people from the mountains of Dharamsala, India, and the jungles of the Ecuadorean Amazon.

61,"But what I think it was telling me is that we are this transient thing that's happening, and that the nature that you see out there -- the untouched shorelines, the untouched forest that I was able to see -- really bring in a sense of that geological time, that this has gone on for a long time, and we're experiencing it in a different way. There's something that we're not seeing there. It was the largest one. And I decided to start looking at something that, to me, had -- if the earlier work of looking at the landscape had a sense of lament to what we were doing to nature, in the recycling work that you're seeing here was starting to point to a direction. And again, I started to think that -- there was another epiphany -- that the whole world I was living in was a result of having plentiful oil. What it is, it's a landscape that is an intentional one. That condition's going to be there for the next 10 to 15 years if they realize what they want, which is, you know, 400 to 500 million more people coming into the cities. And as much as there are great things around the corner -- and it's palpable in this room -- of all of the things that are just about to break that can solve so many problems, I'm really hoping that those things will spread around the world and will start to have a positive effect. And one of the ways I thought of doing it is to use my prize, so I would take 30,000 or 40,000 dollars of the winnings, and the rest is going to be to manage this project, but to use that as prizes for kids to get into their hands.

62,"What I'd like to start off with is an observation, which is that if I've learned anything over the last year, it's that the supreme irony of publishing a book about slowness is that you have to go around promoting it really fast. Because everyone these days wants to know how to slow down, but they want to know how to slow down really quickly. No, we speed them up, don't we? And even things that are by their very nature slow -- we try and speed them up too. And if you go beyond sort of the country level, down at the micro-company level, more and more companies now are realizing that they need to allow their staff either to work fewer hours or just to unplug -- to take a lunch break, or to go sit in a quiet room, to switch off their Blackberrys and laptops -- you at the back -- mobile phones, during the work day or on the weekend, so that they have time to recharge and for the brain to slide into that kind of creative mode of thought. But thankfully, there is a backlash there in parenting as well, and you're finding that, you know, towns in the United States are now banding together and banning extracurriculars on a particular day of the month, so that people can, you know, decompress and have some family time, and slow down. But the new idea, the sort of revolutionary idea, of the Slow Movement, is that there is such a thing as ""good slow,"" too. Because people at the top of the chain, people like you, I think, are starting to realize that there's too much speed in the system, there's too much busyness, and it's time to find, or get back to that lost art of shifting gears. Because I think they're looking at the West, and they're saying, ""Well, we like that aspect of what you've got, but we're not so sure about that."" So all of that said, is it, I guess, is it possible?","people want to know how to slow down, but they want to know how to slow down really quickly. there is a backlash there in parenting as well, and there is such a thing as ""good slow,"" too. john sutter: it's time to find, or get back to that lost art of shifting gears.","Journalist Carl Honoré believes the Western world's emphasis on speed erodes health, productivity and quality of life.

That the success of sliced bread, like the success of almost everything we've talked about at this conference, is not always about what the patent is like, or what the factory is like -- it's about can you get your idea to spread, or not. And I think that the way you're going to get what you want, or cause the change that you want to change, to happen, is to figure out a way to get your ideas to spread. But in a world where the TV-industrial complex is broken, I don't think that's a strategy we want to use any more. I think the strategy we want to use is to not market to these people because they're really good at ignoring you. These are the people who are obsessed with something. It has a strategy, and what they do is, they enter a city, they talk to the people, with the otaku, and then they spread through the city to the people who've just crossed the street.

And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy and they say, ""I thought you knew something about plants. Wherever you look around the world, you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away; these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to: whether it's the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the Penan -- a nomadic people from Southeast Asia, from Sarawak -- a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago, and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers, where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of Borneo away to the South China Sea, where the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest -- or, in the case of the Yanomami, it's the disease entities that have come in, in the wake of the discovery of gold. And it's within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are: a fully conscious species, fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish.

67,"So, this talk is going to be about how do we make things and what are the new ways that we're going to make things in the future. Now, TED sends you a lot of spam if you're a speaker about ""do this, do that"" and you fill out all these forms, and you don't actually know how they're going to describe you, and it flashed across my desk that they were going to introduce me as a futurist. Well, it turns out biology has this other very interesting meme, that you can take a linear string, which is a convenient thing to copy, and you can fold that into an arbitrarily complex 3D structure. Now, hopefully, those of you who know anything about graph theory can look at that, and that will satisfy you that that can also do arbitrary 3D structure, and in fact, you know, I can now take a dog, carve it up and then reassemble it so it's a linear string that will fold from a sequence.

So, I'm thinking about, how can we generalize the way we make all sorts of things, so you end up with this sort of guy, right? And I think we have to sort of redefine and rethink how we define structure and materials and assembly things, so that we can really share the information on how you do those things in a more profound way and build on each other's source code for structure. Maybe I'm getting a little too abstract, but you know, this is the sort of -- returning to our comic characters -- this is sort of the universe, or a different universe view, that I think is going to be very prevalent in the future -- from biotech to materials assembly. I've probably got a couple of minutes of questions, or I can show -- I think they also said that I do extreme stuff in the introduction, so I may have to explain that. But, you know, this is another way to look at the -- if you abstract again, this is a structure that is defined by the physics of the universe.","cnn's john sutter will give a talk on how we're going to make things in the future. sutter: we have to redefine and rethink how we define structure and materials. he says this is sort of the universe, or a different universe view, that's going to be prevalent. sutter: we have to share the information on how we make all sorts of things.","Inventor and MacArthur fellow Saul Griffith shares some innovative ideas from his lab -- from ""smart rope"" to a house-sized kite for towing large loads."
68,"It was a very old ritual that seemed symbolic of the political struggle that was changing the face of South Africa. This man was in an NGO feeding center, being helped as much as he could be helped. After the fall of Ceausescu, I went to Romania and discovered a kind of gulag of children, where thousands of orphans were being kept in medieval conditions. I spent a good deal of time with a man who lived with his family on a railway embankment and had lost an arm and a leg in a train accident. It was a story that wasn't trying to sell anything. So many children have been orphaned by the epidemic that grandmothers have taken the place of parents, and a lot of children had been born with HIV. This is an MSF hospital in Cambodia. At the time I was photographing in these different places, I thought I was covering separate stories, but on 9/11 history crystallized, and I understood I'd actually been covering a single story for more than 20 years, and the attack on New York was its latest manifestation. It was obvious that the Shi'ites were a force to be reckoned with, and we would do well to understand them and learn how to deal with them. And they went surfing.","a man who lost an arm and a leg in a train accident was in a gulag of children in Romania. on 9/11 history crystallized, and the attack on new york was its latest manifestation. the attack on new york was obvious that the Shi'ites were a force to be reckoned with.","Accepting his 2007 TED Prize, war photographer James Nachtwey shows his life's work and asks TED to help him continue telling the story with innovative, exciting uses of news photography in the digital era."
69,"We don't have that. A lot of times, when I do a talk like this, I talk about things that everybody in this room I'm sure has already heard of, but most people haven't. One of the biggest levers that we have in the developed world for changing the impact that we have on the planet is changing the way that we live in cities. But unfortunately, most of the people on the planet don't live in the cites we live in. And this is one of the things that we are looking for everywhere. And, you know, you get amazing things. You know? You get new tools for people in the developing world. You know? You know?","most of the people on the planet don't live in the cites we live in. but unfortunately, most of the people don't live in the cites we live in.","Worldchanging.com founder Alex Steffen argues that reducing humanity’s ecological footprint is incredibly vital now, as the western consumer lifestyle spreads to developing countries."
70,"What I'm going to do, in the spirit of collaborative creativity, is simply repeat many of the points that the three people before me have already made, but do them -- this is called ""creative collaboration;"" it's actually called ""borrowing"" -- but do it through a particular perspective, and that is to ask about the role of users and consumers in this emerging world of collaborative creativity that Jimmy and others have talked about. It's when the Internet combines with these kinds of passionate pro-am consumers -- who are knowledgeable; they've got the incentive to innovate; they've got the tools; they want to -- that you get this kind of explosion of creative collaboration. So this is a huge challenge to the way we think creativity comes about. Do you go into your board and say, ""Look, I've got a fantastic idea for an embryonic product in a marginal market, with consumers we've never dealt with before, and I'm not sure it's going to have a big payoff, but it could be really, really big in the future?"" This is the phrase that I've used in some stuff which I've done with a think tank in London called Demos, where we've been looking at these people who are amateurs -- i.e., they do it for the love of it -- but they want to do it to very high standards. This is open; this is closed. Well, the first thing you can say, I think with certainty, is what Yochai has said already -- is there is a great big struggle between those two organizational forms. And so the debates about copyright, digital rights, so on and so forth -- these are all about trying to stifle, in my view, these kinds of organizations. So here is one of the challenges, I think, for people like me, who do a lot of work with government. If you're a games company, and you've got a million players in your game, you only need one percent of them to be co-developers, contributing ideas, and you've got a development workforce of 10,000 people.","""creative collaboration"" is actually called ""borrowing,"" but do it through a particular perspective. when the Internet combines with passionate pro-am consumers, you get this explosion of creative collaboration. the debates about copyright, digital rights, so on and so forth are all about trying to stifle organizations.","In this deceptively casual talk, Charles Leadbeater weaves a tight argument  that innovation isn't just for professionals anymore.

71,"This is actually quite meaningful to me, because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole -- we don't do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it -- and cars are thought so much as a product that it's a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side under the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art. And so cars, as art, brings it into an emotional plane -- if you accept that -- that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital A. And they put that same kind of tension into the sculpting of a car that you do in a great sculpture that you would go and look at in a museum. Why it means you have to wash a car, what is it, that sensuality you have to touch about it? And first of all, you have to go with me for a second, and say, you know, you could take the word ""love"" out of a lot of things in our society, put the word ""design"" in, and it still works, like this quote here, you know. I think this one here, there's a pop song that really describes Philippe Starck for me, you know, this is like you know, this is like puppy love, you know, this is cool right? And this idea that there is more to love, more to design, when it gets down to your neighbor, your other, it can be physical like this, and maybe in the future it will be. So, what we did was: instead of having a staff of artists that are just your wrist, we decided to free up a team of creative designers and engineers to find out what's the successor to the SUV phenomenon in America. And if you can imagine what this is like, to have these months of postcard indication of how great this team is working, and they're out there spending all this money, and they're learning, and they're doing all this stuff. And I think we felt much closer that day, we cut a lot of strings that didn't need to be there, and we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about.","cnn's john sutter talks with a team of car designers and engineers about the future of the SUV. sutter: ""we decided to free up a team of creative designers and engineers to find out what's the successor to the SUV phenomenon in America"" ""we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about,"" he says.","American designer Chris Bangle explains his philosophy that car design is an art form in its own right, with an entertaining -- and ultimately moving -- account of the BMW Group's Deep Blue project, intended to create the SUV of the future."
72,"Because I have to say, for my whole career, if there's anything that's been consistent, it's been that you can't do it. And I've had for 30 years an interest in a series of complexities where a series of forces are brought to bear, and to understand the nature of the final result of that, representing the building itself. And I'd been extremely interested in this notion of randomness as it produces architectural work and as it definitely connects to the notion of the city, an accretional notion of the city, and that led to various ideas of organization. It became kind of an idea for the notion of the surface of a work, and it was used in a project where we could unravel that surface, and it was a figurative idea that was going to be folded and made into a very, kind of complex space. And the idea was the relationship of the space, which was made up of the fold of the image, and the dialectic or the conflict between the figuration, and the clarity of the image and the complexity of the space, which were in dialog. It has a material identity and it's translucent and it's porous, and it allows us for a very different notion of what a skin of a building is. And what we really want to do -- well, the architects, if there are architects out there, this is the Laugier Hut; this is the primitive hut that's been around for so long -- and what we wanted to do is really build this, because they see themselves as the caretakers of the world, and we wanted them to look down at their satellite, how they see their own site, that eight-acre site, and we wanted nothing left. And a project that was realized in Austria, the Hooper Bank, which again used this idea of connecting typology, the traditional buildings, and morphology, or the relationship of the development of land as an idea, into a complex, which is a piece of a city where we can see part of it is literally just this augmenting, this movement of the land that's a very simple idea of just lifting it up and occupying it, and other parts are much more energetic and intense. And talk about that intensity in terms of the collisions of the kind of events they make that have to do with putting a series of systems together, and then where part of it is in the ground, part of it is oppositional lifts. And I'm a character that's extremely interested in understanding the nature of that constructed reality because there's no such thing as nature any more.","a series of forces are brought to bear, and to understand the nature of the final result. a figurative idea that was going to be folded and made into a very, kind of complex space. a project that was realized in Austria, the Hooper Bank, is a piece of a city.","Architect Thom Mayne has never been one to take the easy option, and this whistle-stop tour of the buildings he's created makes you glad for it. These are big ideas cast in material form."
73,"Now, why do I say that this is a big problem? Well, let's first look at the probability -- and this is very, very difficult to estimate -- but there have been only four studies on this in recent years, which is surprising. You would think that it would be of some interest to try to find out more about this given that the stakes are so big, but it's a very neglected area. And if we think about this, I think it's very clear that there are ways in which we could change things, not just by eliminating negatives, but adding positives. As far as I can see, all of you are users of this enhancement technology in this room, so that's a great thing. It's just better to be able to understand more of the world around you and the people that you are communicating with, and to remember what you have learned. It's also interesting to think about what other things are -- so if these all enabled great values, why should we think that evolution has happened to provide us with all the modalities we would need to engage with other values that there might be? And they would just stare at us with bafflement when we spend time listening to a beautiful performance, like the one we just heard -- because of people making stupid movements, and they would be really irritated and wouldn't see what we were up to. If you could actually choose to preserve your romantic attachments to one person, undiminished through time, so that wouldn't have to -- love would never have to fade if you didn't want it to. And then you can imagine some enhancements of human capacities.","there have been only four studies on this topic in recent years. aaron carroll: we could change things, not just by eliminating negatives, but adding positives. he says evolution has provided us with all the modalities we would need to engage with other values. carroll: if you could choose to preserve your romantic attachments to one person, undiminished through time.",Oxford philosopher and transhumanist Nick Bostrom examines the future of humankind and asks whether we might alter the fundamental nature of humanity to solve our most intrinsic problems.
74,"And I think, a lot of times, what we do is just, sort of, hold the mirror up to our clients, and sort of go, ""Duh! And the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day, all you do is look at the roof, and it's a really shitty experience. And another idea, again, that came from one of the nurses -- which I love -- was they took traditional, sort of, corporate white boards, then they put them on one wall of the patient's room, and they put this sticker there. So this is not particularly a new idea, kind of, seeing opportunities in things that are around you and snapping and turning them into a solution. This idea of the way that people cobble together solutions in our life -- and the things we kind of do in our environment that are somewhat subconscious but have huge potential -- is something that we look at a lot. So what is this? And putting yourself in the position of the person, and I think that's one of the threads that I've heard again from this conference is how do we put ourselves in other peoples' shoes and really feel what they feel? And I think that's what this is very much about. What do we do to start? So that's it.","a lot of times, what we do is just, sort of, hold the mirror up to our clients. a lot of times, what we do is just look at the roof, and it's a really shitty experience. putting ourselves in the position of the person is what this conference is about.","Showing a series of inspiring, unusual and playful products, British branding and design guru Paul Bennett explains that design doesn't have to be about grand gestures, but can solve small, universal and overlooked problems."
75,"And this is what this adventure's really about. (Laughter) It turns out that what this stuff is -- and Richard Dawkins has written about this -- is, this is really a river out of Eden. So, it's about the size of a little period on a sentence. Because each of us contains our entire gene code of where we've been for the past billion years, because we've evolved from that stuff, you can take that tree of life and collapse it back, and in the measure that you learn to reprogram, maybe we'll give birth to something that is very close to the first primordial ooze. And what you can do now is, you can outlay exactly what your chromosome is, and what the gene code on that chromosome is right here, and what those genes code for, and what animals they code against, and then you can tie it to the literature. They look at the same world and they say... (Laughter) That's how the same gene code -- that's why you have 30,000 genes, mice have 30,000 genes, husbands have 30,000 genes.

82,"(Laughter) I'm also a software engineer, and I make lots of different kinds of art with the computer. And I think the main thing that I'm interested in is trying to find a way of making the computer into a personal mode of expression. And many of you out there are the heads of Macromedia and Microsoft, and in a way those are my bane: I think there's a great homogenizing force that software imposes on people and limits the way they think about what's possible on the computer. Of course, it's also a great liberating force that makes possible, you know, publishing and so forth, and standards, and so on. But, in a way, the computer makes possible much more than what most people think, and my art has just been about trying to find a personal way of using the computer, and so I end up writing software to do that. Chris has asked me to do a short performance, and so I'm going to take just this time -- maybe 10 minutes -- to do that, and hopefully at the end have just a moment to show you a couple of my other projects in video form.

83,"However, that's just the initial idea I may have that we all get when we actually look and we try to interpret. Much more -- (Drum sound) and I just feel, at last, one with the stick and one with the drum. And so what we would do is that I would put my hands on the wall of the music room, and together, we would ""listen"" to the sounds of the instruments, and really try to connect with those sounds far, far more broadly than simply depending on the ear. And so therefore, I said to them, ""Well, look, if you refuse -- if you refuse me through those reasons, as opposed to the ability to perform and to understand and love the art of creating sound -- then we have to think very, very hard about the people you do actually accept."" And of course, being the participator of the sound, and that is, starting from the idea of what type of sound I want to produce, for example, this sound: (No sound) Can you hear anything? So all of my performances are based on entirely what I experience, and not by learning a piece of music, putting on someone else's interpretation of it, buying all the CDs possible of that particular piece of music, and so on and so forth, because that isn't giving me enough of something that is so raw and so basic, and something that I can fully experience the journey of. So, because of this explosion in access to sound, especially through the Deaf community, this has not only affected how music institutions, how schools for the deaf treat sound, and not just as a means of therapy -- although, of course, being a participator of music, that definitely is the case as well -- but it's meant that acousticians have had to really think about the types of halls they put together. I cannot give you any detail as far as what is actually happening with those halls, but it's just the fact that they are going to a group of people for whom so many years, we've been saying, ""Well, how on earth can they experience music? No, I don't like that piece,"" and so on. It may be that the chemistry isn't quite right between myself and that particular piece of music, but that doesn't mean I have the right to say it's a bad piece of music.","acousticians have had to think about the types of halls they put together for the deaf.

Now, something like this can be used because this is after all talk about design, too. Can you see this? You learn something in the sort of thing that I do, which is there are people out there with a lot of time on their hands.

86,"But if I had one thing to say about this, before we get to first, it would be that from the time we started building this, the big idea wasn't the technology. Over the last hundred years, we started building cars, and then over the 50 years we've connected every city to every other city in an extraordinarily efficient way, and we have a very high standard of living as a consequence of that. If five percent of that population became, quote, middle class, and wanted to go the way we've gone in the last hundred years at the same time that 50 percent of their population are moving into cities of the size and density of Manhattan, every six weeks -- it isn't sustainable environmentally; it isn't sustainable economically -- there just ain't enough oil -- and it's not sustainable politically. But rather than go license this off, which is what we normally do, it seemed to me that if we put all our effort not into the technology, but into an understanding of a world that's solved all its other problems, but has somehow come to accept that cities -- which, right back from ancient Greece on, were meant to walk around, cities that were architected and built for people -- now have a footprint that, while we've solved every other transportation problem -- and it's like Moore's law. So you wonder, what if cities could give to their pedestrians what we take for granted as we now go between cities? What if it would make it a little bit more palatable to have access via this, as that last link to mass transit, to get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbs and use our cars the way we want, and then have our cities energized again? Or maybe we should be out in the street in front of a Greyhound bus or a vehicle. But if I could ask you to do one thing, it's not to think about it as a piece of technology, but just imagine that, although we all understand somehow that it's reasonable that we use our 4,000-pound machine, which can go 60 miles an hour, that can bring you everywhere you want to go, and somehow it's also what we used for the last mile, and it's broken, and it doesn't work. (Applause) The bottom line is, whether you believe the United Nations, or any of the other think tanks -- in the next 20 years, all human population growth on this planet will be in cities. So if we put this box on here in a few years, could we have a solution to transportation, electricity, and communication, and maybe drinkable water in a sustainable package that weighs 60 pounds?","john avlon: from the time we started building this, the big idea wasn't the technology. avlon: it's not sustainable environmentally; it's not sustainable economically. avlon: if we put all our effort not into the technology, it's like Moore's law. avlon: if we put all our effort into an understanding of a world that's solved other problems.",Inventor Dean Kamen lays out his argument for the Segway and offers a peek into his next big ideas (portable energy and water purification for developing countries).
87,"(Laughter) So this is a mantis shrimp. And so what we did is, we took a look at these videos, and we measured how fast the limb was moving to get back to that original question. (Laughter) So, this -- what I saw, on every single mantis shrimp limb, whether it's a spearer or a smasher, is a beautiful saddle-shaped structure right on the top surface of the limb. And then we did a series of calculations, and what we were able to show is that these mantis shrimp have to have a spring. So we thought, OK, this must be a spring -- the saddle could very well be a spring. And so all I had to do was actually put a little shrimp paste on the front of the load cell, and they'd smash away at it. And so this is just a regular video of the animal just smashing the heck out of this load cell. And what that is, is cavitation. So this is a potent force in fluid systems, and just to sort of take it one step further, I'm going to show you the mantis shrimp approaching the snail. And what they do is, up until that time period when they can't strike, they become really obnoxious and awful, and they strike everything in sight; it doesn't matter who or what.",mantis shrimp have a saddle-shaped structure on every single limb. mantis shrimp have to have a spring. cavitation is a potent force in fluid systems.,"Biologist Sheila Patek talks about her work measuring the feeding strike of the mantis shrimp, one of the fastest movements in the animal world, using video cameras recording at 20,000 frames per second."

Now this is typically how you see sunfish, this is where they get their common name. So I was just intrigued with what -- you know, what is this animal's story? Now I don't know how you'd feed a child like that but -- we don't know how fast the Molas grow in the wild, but captive growth studies at the Monterey Bay Aquarium -- one of the first places to have them in captivity -- they had one that gained 800 lbs in 14 months. How do you do that with an animal -- very few places in the world. So the great thing about the Mola is that when we put the tag on them -- if you look up here -- that's streaming off, that's right where we put the tag. And we'd love to tag here -- this is an aerial shot of Monterey -- but unfortunately, the Molas here end up looking like this because another one of our locals really likes Molas but in the wrong way. And I'm not exaggerating, it is just -- and sometimes they don't eat them, it's just spiteful. And this is a day in the life of a Mola, and if we -- they're up and down, and up and down, and up and down, and up and up and down, up to 40 times a day.

91,"But, you know, we've just come from this discussion of what a bird might be. Someone heard the six hours of talk that I gave called ""The Monticello Dialogues"" on NPR, and sent me this as a thank you note -- ""We realize that design is a signal of intention, but it also has to occur within a world, and we have to understand that world in order to imbue our designs with inherent intelligence, and so as we look back at the basic state of affairs in which we design, we, in a way, need to go to the primordial condition to understand the operating system and the frame conditions of a planet, and I think the exciting part of that is the good news that's there, because the news is the news of abundance, and not the news of limits, and I think as our culture tortures itself now with tyrannies and concerns over limits and fear, we can add this other dimension of abundance that is coherent, driven by the sun, and start to imagine what that would be like to share.""

92,"So this is some of the challenge that we have here, is you can see that it's actually kind of hard to get the -- there we go. Now what I would like to do is just to show you what one second of this activity would look like. In fact, many of the organizations that are here -- the Acumen Fund, I think ApproTEC we have running, I'm not sure if that one's up yet -- and many of the people who have presented here are running through Google Grants. And Sergey mentioned Orkut, which is something that, you know, Orkut wanted to do in his time, and we call this -- at Google, we've embodied this as ""the 20 percent time,"" and the idea is, for 20 percent of your time, if you're working at Google, you can do what you think is the best thing to do. And I think many other things in the world also have come out of this.

We're going to have -- (Applause) -- we're going to have to live closer to where we work.

107,"So we said, what is -- KA: It was not an inclusive group? And we also, frankly, knew that if it didn't happen by the end of the Giuliani administration, then everyone who we were dealing with at the DOT and the Police Department and all of the -- we were meeting with 20 or 30 people with the city at a time, and it was set up by the Office of Emergency Management. So the first thing we had to do was find a way to get this -- we had to work with the families of the victims, through the city, to make sure that they knew this was happening. And I think this was the 21st, and we knew this had to be built and up by the 28th. There was no sense of the fact that this is next to Saint Paul -- that this is really a place that needs to be kind of dignified, and a place to reflect and remember. And I think people were amazed at two things -- I think they were amazed at the destruction, but I think there was a sense of disbelief about the heroics of New Yorkers that I found very moving. DR: Well here's the issue: we knew that this was not in the sense of -- we think about the site, and think about the need for a memorial. DR: No, I don't think so. What's interesting now is the nature of the site has totally changed, so that what you're aware of is not just the destruction of the buildings in Ground Zero, but all of the buildings around it -- and the scars on the building around it, which are enormous.

Now, the news footage I put in there to try to show -- you know, I think mainstream media tries to do the best they can in the format that they have. But the thing that I know you all have heard a lot of times, American soldiers saying, ""Why don't they talk about the good stuff that we do?"" And for me, one of the most profound stories someone shared with me, that then became my story, was -- for those of you who haven't seen the film, and it's not a spoiler -- it's very common there are a lot of civilian accidents, where people get in front of Humvees and they get killed.

If you want to know about Africa, read our literature -- and not just ""Things Fall Apart,"" because that would be like saying, ""I've read 'Gone with the Wind' and so I know everything about America."" So, what it says to me then is that it's not really -- the problem isn't really the stories that are being told or which stories are being told, the problem really is the terms of humanity that we're willing to bring to complicate every story, and that's really what it's all about.

111,"But this is about Africa, the story we have not heard. A part of my talk is going to be about investment opportunities that exist on this continent, to separate the rhetoric from the reality, the fact from the fiction. The lesson from that was that it was Africa -- an African story -- that was used to share news with the rest of the world of what the benchmark can be for corporate turnarounds. And the Siwa Oasis is famous for several things, but the key thing is that it was the place that Alexander the Great went to when he wanted to find out what his destiny had in store for him. And while Africa may be dark, the thing that brought the message home to me was that this is the challenge we are facing, but it's also the opportunity. Because whilst Africa may be dark -- other than the few specks that exist north and in the south and other areas -- it's aglow with the light in the hearts of the millions of people that are there. And the first myth to dispel is that Africa is not a country. But the story of Africa, and my focus, is beyond South Africa because there's so much happening. I want to talk about it from the perspective of capital markets. This time [I'll] give you the entire picture that I saw in 2002, and ask you that when you think about what your role can be in Africa, think about your journey in terms of bringing light to this continent.","the siwa oasis is famous for several things, but the key thing is that it was the place that Alexander the Great went to when he wanted to find out what his destiny had in store for him. while Africa may be dark, it's aglow with the light in the hearts of the millions of people that are there.",South African investment banker Euvin Naidoo explains why investing in Africa can make great business sense.
112,"We all have come from a long way, here in Africa, and converged in this region of Africa, which is a place where 90 percent of our evolutionary process took place. And I say that not because I am African, but it's in Africa that you find the earliest evidence for human ancestors, upright walking traces, even the first technologies in the form of stone tools. Because it's only when you do that, that you can talk about -- (Laughter) -- it's only when you do that, [that] you can talk about how we looked like and how we behaved at different times, and how those likes and looks and behaviors changed through time. Of course, they cannot, but I'm telling you already that the environment and the carrying capacity of this region was drastically different from what we have today. But to do that, you need the permanent dentition, which you don't see here, because what you have here are the baby teeth. And to know how old she was when she died, what you do is you do an informed estimate, and you say, how much time would be required to form this amount of teeth, and the answer was three. So, with all that information, the big question is -- what do we actually -- what does she tell us? What do we actually know about our ancestors? Of course, in addition to extracting this huge amount of scientific information as to what makes us human, you know, the many human ancestors that have existed over the past six million years -- and there are more than 10 -- they did not have the knowledge, the technology and sophistications that we, Homo sapiens, have today. So finally, I would like to say, so let's help Africa walk upright and forward, then we all can be proud of our future legacy as a species.","gene seymour: 90 percent of our evolutionary process took place in this region of africa. he says it's in this region that you find the earliest evidence for human ancestors. seymour: let's help africa walk upright and forward, then we can be proud of our legacy.",Paleoanthropologist Zeresenay Alemseged looks for the roots of humanity in Ethiopia's badlands.

Yesterday, a number of people -- Nicholas Negroponte and others -- spoke about all the wonderful things that are happening when our ideas get spread out, thanks to all the new technology all over the world.

The second false premise that we make when we're trying to help Africa is that sometimes we think that there is something called a government in Africa that cares about its people, serves the interests of the people, and represents the people. The third fundamental issue that we have to recognize is that if we want to help the African people, we must know where the African people are. Now the modern sector, of course, is where a lot of the development aid and resources went into. The other sectors, the informal and the traditional sectors, are where you find the majority of the African people, the real people in Africa. Now, this is what I have described to you.

If you look at the math, E=mc squared, if you look at the cosmological constant, where there's an anthropic ideal, where you see that life had to evolve from the numbers that describe the universe -- these are things that are really difficult to understand. And what I've tried to do since I had my training as a medical illustrator -- since I was taught animation by my father, who was a sculptor and my visual mentor -- I wanted to figure out a way to help people understand truth and beauty in the biological sciences by using animation, by using pictures, by telling stories so that the things that are not necessarily evident to people can be brought forth, and can be taught, and can be understood. And so what we wanted to do was to figure out how we could make this story into an animation that would be the centerpiece of BioVisions at Harvard, which is a website that Harvard has for its molecular and cellular biology students that will -- in addition to all the textual information, in addition to all the didactic stuff -- put everything together visually, so that these students would have an internalized view of what a cell really is in all of its truth and beauty, and be able to study with this view in mind, so that their imaginations would be sparked, so that their passions would be sparked and so that they would be able to go on and use these visions in their head to make new discoveries and to be able to find out, really, how life works. And figure out how to do this in a way that was truthful in that it imparted what was going on, but not so truthful that the compact crowding in a cell would prevent the vista from happening. But these machines that power the inside of the cells are really quite amazing, and they really are the basis of all life because all of these machines interact with each other. (Laughter) So what I want you to do when you go home is think about this, and think about how powerful our cells are. Once we figure out all that's going on -- and believe me, we know almost a percent of what's going on -- once we figure out what's going on, we're really going to be able to have a lot of control over what we do with our health, with what we do with future generations, and how long we're going to live.","""biovisions"" is a website for students of molecular and cellular biology. it's a way to help people understand truth and beauty in the biological sciences.

But I want to put a caveat on my argument, and that caveat is that it is not true that aid is always destructive. Aid increases the resources available to governments, and that makes working in a government the most profitable thing you can have, as a person in Africa seeking a career. I also want to say that it is important for us to note that, over the last 50 years, Africa has been receiving increasing aid from the international community, in the form of technical assistance, and financial aid, and all other forms of aid. Between 1960 and 2003, our continent received 600 billion dollars of aid, and we are still told that there is a lot of poverty in Africa. Why does the government of Uganda budget spend 110 percent of its own revenue?","an average african country receives foreign aid to the tune of 13, 15 percent of its GDP. john sutter asks: why should people support their government? sutter says it is not true that aid is always destructive.","In this provocative talk, journalist Andrew Mwenda asks us to reframe the ""African question"" -- to look beyond the media's stories of poverty, civil war and helplessness and see the opportunities for creating wealth and happiness throughout the continent."
125,"This would be an example of how to do that. So which verbs go in which construction -- the problem with which I began -- depends on whether the verb specifies a kind of motion or a kind of possession change. You can think of this as the language of thought, or ""mentalese."" It seems to be based on a fixed set of concepts, which govern dozens of constructions and thousands of verbs -- not only in English, but in all other languages -- fundamental concepts such as space, time, causation and human intention, such as, what is the means and what is the ends? You can also say, ""Biff went from sick to well."" Second conclusion is that the ability to conceive of a given event in two different ways, such as ""cause something to go to someone"" and ""causing someone to have something,"" I think is a fundamental feature of human thought, and it's the basis for much human argumentation, in which people don't differ so much on the facts as on how they ought to be construed. And I think the biggest picture of all would take seriously the fact that so much of our verbiage about abstract events is based on a concrete metaphor and see human intelligence itself as consisting of a repertoire of concepts -- such as objects, space, time, causation and intention -- which are useful in a social, knowledge-intensive species, whose evolution you can well imagine, and a process of metaphorical abstraction that allows us to bleach these concepts of their original conceptual content -- space, time and force -- and apply them to new abstract domains, therefore allowing a species that evolved to deal with rocks and tools and animals, to conceptualize mathematics, physics, law and other abstract domains. For example, in polite requests, if someone says, ""If you could pass the guacamole, that would be awesome,"" we know exactly what he means, even though that's a rather bizarre concept being expressed. You want to express the bribe, the command, the promise, the solicitation and so on, but you also have to negotiate and maintain the kind of relationship you have with the other person. On the other hand, with indirect language, if you issue a veiled bribe, then the dishonest officer could interpret it as a bribe, in which case you get the payoff of going free.","""mentalese"" seems to be based on a fixed set of concepts, says dr. sanjay gupta. ability to conceive of a given event in two different ways is a fundamental feature of human thought. gupta: human intelligence itself is consisting of a repertoire of concepts.","In an exclusive preview of his book <i>The Stuff of Thought</i>, Steven Pinker looks at language and how it expresses what goes on in our minds -- and how the words we choose communicate much more than we realize."

129,"While it is true that those things are going on, there's an Africa that you don't hear about very much. And therefore, when you hear about the corrupt Africa -- corruption all the time -- I want you to know that the people and the governments are trying hard to fight this in some of the countries, and that some successes are emerging. But let me say this: if Alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in London -- if the other people who had taken money, estimated at 20 to 40 billion now of developing countries' monies sitting abroad in the developed countries -- if they're able to do this, what is that? We have to do it. And this is what we started to do in one of the largest countries on the continent, Nigeria. But there's a huge market out there, and people don't know about it, or they don't want to know. And what is more important, because we want to get away from oil and diversify -- and there are so many opportunities in this one big country, as in many countries in Africa -- what was remarkable is that much of this growth came not from the oil sector alone, but from non-oil. But you should know that this continent is not -- is a continent of many countries, not one country. And I want to say that some of the best people to invest in on the continent are the women. When you go to Tanzania, listen carefully, because I'm sure you will hear of the various openings that there will be for you to get involved in something that will do good for the continent, for the people and for yourselves.","alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in London. some of the best people to invest in on the continent are the women, he says. africa is not a continent of many countries, not one country, he says.","We know the negative images of Africa -- famine and disease, conflict and corruption.

130,"If you follow policy, you probably know that a few years ago the president pledged 15 billion dollars to fight the epidemic over five years, and a lot of that money is going to go to programs that try to replicate Uganda and use behavior change to encourage people and decrease the epidemic. So today I'm going to talk about some things that you might not know about the epidemic, and I'm actually also going to challenge some of these things that you think that you do know. I think it may seem like I'm ignoring the policy stuff, which is really the most important, but I'm hoping that at the end of this talk you will conclude that we actually cannot develop effective policy unless we really understand how the epidemic works. So this means that in a place with a lot of AIDS, there's a really significant cost of sex. But I'm going to argue that you shouldn't be surprised by this, and that to understand this you need to think about health the way than an economist does -- as an investment. So one way to test to see whether we can explain some of this behavior change by differences in life expectancy is to look and see is there more behavior change in areas where there's less malaria. Then if you poked a little more, you looked a little more at what was going on, you'd find that actually that was a pretty good year, because in some years the only people tested are IV drug users. And I think that the answer is, we can look at mortality data, and we can use mortality data to figure out what the prevalence was in the past. But it also tells us something about one of these things that we think that we know. So if you combine the intuition in this figure with some of the data that I talked about before, it suggests that somewhere between 25 percent and 50 percent of the decline in prevalence in Uganda actually would have happened even without any education campaign.",president obama pledged 15 billion dollars to fight the AIDS epidemic in Uganda. aaron carroll: we can't develop effective policy unless we really understand how the epidemic works. he says behavior change can be explained by differences in life expectancy in areas with less malaria. carroll: we can use mortality data to figure out what the prevalence was in the past.,Emily Oster re-examines the stats on AIDS in Africa from an economic perspective and reaches a stunning conclusion: Everything we know about the spread of HIV on the continent is wrong.

And, mostly because people never really ask you, and when they do, you don't really think they want to know the truth. Both of them live at the confluence of public health and enterprise, and both of them, because they're manufacturers, create jobs directly, and create incomes indirectly, because they're in the malaria sector, and Africa loses about 13 billion dollars a year because of malaria. And so, Anuj and Acumen have been talking about testing the private sector, because the assumption that the aid establishment has made is that, look, in a country like Tanzania, 80 percent of the population makes less than two dollars a day. And so we came in with a second round of patient capital to A to Z, a loan as well as a grant, so that A to Z could play with pricing and listen to the marketplace, and found a number of things.

145,"(Laughter) So now, we are going to speak of happiness. But now, if it is something that is going to determine the quality of every instant of our life, then we better know what it is, have some clearer idea. And probably, the fact that we don't know that is why, so often, although we seek happiness, it seems we turn our back to it. And also, again, it can -- also, it's something that you -- it is not something that is radiating outside. Now, what, then, will be happiness?

It cannot be tainted intrinsically with hatred or jealousy because then, if it was always there -- like a dye that would permeate the whole cloth -- then it would be found all the time, somewhere. We think of people suffering, of people we love, but at some point, it can be a state which is all pervading.","we don't know what happiness is, so often we turn our back to it. happiness cannot be tainted intrinsically with hatred or jealousy. we think of people suffering, of people we love, but at some point, it can be a state.","What is happiness, and how can we all get some?

My view is that if you want to involve yourself in the life of people who have been given up on, you have to look like the solution and not the problem. And I happen to know that company pretty well because John Heinz, who was our U.S. senator -- who was tragically killed in a plane accident -- he had heard about my desire to build a new building, because I had a cardboard box and I put it in a garbage bag and I walking all over Pittsburgh trying to raise money for this site. I said, ""Senator, I'm reluctant to go into a field that I don't know much about, but I promise you that if you'll support my school, I'll get it built and in a couple of years, I'll come back and weigh out that program that you desire.""

148,"So if you look, you can see a lot of different machines come out of this. They all crawl in different ways, and you can see on the right, that we actually made a couple of these things, and they work in reality. These are not very fantastic robots, but they evolved to do exactly what we reward them for: for moving forward. So that was all done in simulation, but we can also do that on a real machine. And you can see these robots are not ready to take over the world yet, but they gradually learn how to move forward, and they do this autonomously. You look at it and you see it has four legs, the machine doesn't know if it's a snake, if it's a tree, it doesn't have any idea what it looks like, but it's going to try to find that out. It kind of figured out what it looks like, and how to move forward, and then actually tried that out. And we've actually built a couple of these, and this is part of a larger robot made out of these cubes. So of course, this is a very crude machine, but we're working on a micro-scale version of these, and hopefully the cubes will be like a powder that you pour in. And one of the things that I think is important is that we have to get away from this idea of designing the machines manually, but actually let them evolve and learn, like children, and perhaps that's the way we'll get there.","we're working on a micro-scale version of these robots. the robots are not ready to take over the world yet. they gradually learn how to move forward, and they do this autonomously.","Hod Lipson demonstrates a few of his cool little robots, which have the ability to learn, understand themselves and even self-replicate."

So now the thing is, this is a different kind of spell. And so, I'm here to tell you, you don't need a computer to actually have a spell. So then, we think we can do that. One of my first questions doing this was: How can you make an arbitrary shape or pattern out of DNA? I decided to use a type of DNA origami, where you take a long strand of DNA and fold it into whatever shape or pattern you might want. These short DNA sequences are what are going to fold the long strand into this shape that we want to make. So you get 250 of these in the mail in little tubes.

And we do all this -- and to go back to the original question, what do people carry? And I'm not saying this is a good thing, but this is a thing, right? You don't need to ask permission from anyone, you can just go ahead and do it, right? OK, the next thing is -- most of you, if you have a stable home life, and what I mean is that you don't travel all the time, and always in hotels, but most people have what we call a center of gravity. Just from a design perspective, we didn't really understand how they did it, and so that's just one small example of the kind of research that we were doing. If you go on the streets of India and China, you see this kind of stuff. And I look at something like this and it makes me question, if we were to take all the functionality in things like this, and redistribute them around the body in some kind of personal area network, how would we prioritize where to put stuff?

But I want to jump up to shallow water now and look at some creatures that are positively amazing. (Laughter) This is an octopus.

I'll give you two different ways to think about this problem that are the beginning of my thinking about how to think about it. So here's one way to think about it, which is that we just do this instead of cutting emissions because it's cheaper. Let's say that we don't do geo-engineering, we do what we ought to do, which is get serious about cutting emissions. Right now, you have a few enthusiasts talking about it, some in a positive side, some in a negative side -- but that's a dangerous state to be in because there's very little depth of knowledge on this topic. I think there is a serious problem: as you talk about this, people begin to think they don't need to work so hard to cut emissions.

156,"The United States, for example, can completely eliminate its use of oil and rejuvenate the economy at the same time, led by business for profit, because it's so much cheaper to save and substitute for the oil than to keep on buying it. We can save half the oil by using it more efficiently, at a cost of 12 dollars per saved barrel. You can sort of have it all with these things. And the reason this has not been very seriously examined before is there was a common assumption in the industry that -- well, then it might not be safe if you got whacked by a heavy car, and it would cost a lot more to make, because the only way we know how to make cars much lighter was to use expensive light metals like aluminum and magnesium. And when you make them light in the right way, that can be simpler and cheaper to make. Now, when you go through a similar analysis for every way we use oil, including buildings, industry, feedstocks and so on, you find that of the 28 million barrels a day the government says we will need in 2025, well, about eight of that can be removed by efficiency by then, with another seven still being saved as the vehicle stocks turn over, at an average cost of only 12 bucks a barrel, instead of 26 for buying the oil. There is a huge amount of gas to be saved, about half the projected gas at about an eighth of its price. Or we could use the saved gas directly to cover all of this balance, or if we used it as hydrogen, which is more profitable and efficient, we'd get rid of the domestic oil too. And the one thing I'd like to point out here is that we've done this before.

166,"So, I had a $100,000 debt, and I noticed that the Kramer prize for human-powered flight, which had then been around for -- (Laughter) -- 17 years at the time, was 50,000 pounds, which, at the exchange rate, was just about 100,000 dollars. (Laughter) But that sure started me thinking about various things, and immediately, we began making a solar-powered plane because we felt solar power was going to be so important for the country and the world, we didn't want the small funding in the government to be decreased, which is what the government was trying to do with it.

167,"And all of these robotic missions are part of a bigger human journey: a voyage to understand something, to get a sense of our cosmic place, to understand something of our origins, and how Earth, our planet, and we, living on it, came to be. It has a very large, thick atmosphere, and in fact, its surface environment was believed to be more like the environment we have here on the Earth, or at least had in the past, than any other body in the solar system. And so it turns out that methane is to Titan what water is to the Earth. (Laughter) That is the view that we had of the surface of Titan before we got there with Cassini,   and I can tell you that what we have found on Titan, though it is not the same in detail, is every bit as fascinating as that story is. And what you see is bright and dark regions, and that's about as far as it got for us. This, we later found out, is, in fact, a crater, but there are very few craters on the surface of Titan, meaning it's a very young surface. It is so significant that, in my mind, this was an event that should have been celebrated with ticker tape parades in every city across the U.S. and Europe, and sadly, that wasn't the case. And I can't tell you what it was like to see the first pictures of Titan's surface from the probe.

168,"And that got me into a discussion with some other people, other scientists, about maybe some other subjects, and one of the guys I talked to, who was a neuroscientist, said, ""You know, I think there are a lot of solutions to the problems you brought up,"" and reminds me of Michael's talk yesterday and his mother saying you can't have a solution if you don't have a problem. But I also hope, because I think the people in this room can literally change the world, I hope you take some of this stuff away with you, and when you have an opportunity to be influential, that you try to get some heavy-duty money spent on some of these ideas. And with the kind of computing power we have now, there is, as I say, some of this going on, but it needs money. What can we do about this? But what happens, as this occurs, is that we lose our magnetic field around the Earth over the period of about 100 years, and that means that all these cosmic rays and particles that are to come streaming at us from the sun, that this field protects us from, are -- well, basically, we're gonna fry. You don't need that much up there. But the alarming thing is that astronomers recently have been studying stars that are similar to our Sun, and they've found that a number of them, when they're about the age of our Sun, brighten by a factor of as much as 20. So, what can we do about this? So, what can we do about it?

170,"I'm going to tell you three stories on the way to one argument that's going to tell you a little bit about how we open user-generated content up for business. Now, that was a pretty good system for most of the history of the regulation of land, until this technology came along, and people began to wonder, were these instruments trespassers as they flew over land without clearing the rights of the farms below as they traveled across the country? And the important point to recognize is that even though these broadcasters were broadcasting something you would call second best, that competition was enough to break, at that time, this legal cartel over access to music.

172,"The exhibition was meant to be a way to have children think of doing ... you know when they do homeworks at home? Design can be that, of course, but it can also be this. You really have power in that people usually tend to know about your exhibition or see the exhibitions, and that is power because in a design museum I wouldn't have as many visitors. There have been many episodes, and actually Eames Demetrius may be here in the audience, but in two instances, his great-grandfather, grandfather -- I'm always a little perplexed about the relation, exactly -- Charles Eames the first time and then Charles and Ray Eames the second time were involved in two competitions: one in 1940, it was about organic furniture, and the second one in 1948 was low-cost furniture for the GIs coming back from the war that then sparked a whole line of furniture. And then, for instance, this other exhibition that was entitled Workspheres in 2001, where I asked different designers to come up with ideas for the new type of work styles that were happening in the world at that time. But the interesting thing in the exhibition is the discovery that the ultimate shelter is your sense of self, and there are quite a few designers that are working on this particular topic. And it was really interesting because I was the last speaker and before me there were people that were really talking about luxury, and I didn't want to be a party pooper but at the same time I felt that I had to kind of bring back the discourse to reality. So they're quite beautiful, but they're beautiful because they're so smart and economical. (Laughter) It's quite beautiful because somehow, this is a gorgeous moment for design. For instance, this is a beautiful container for asthma medicine that kind of inflates itself when it's time for you to take the medicine, so the child has to go -- pffff!","the ultimate shelter is your sense of self. the exhibition was meant to be a way to have children think of doing homeworks. it's beautiful because somehow, this is a gorgeous moment for design.","Paola Antonelli, design curator at New York's Museum of Modern Art, wants to spread her appreciation of design -- in all shapes and forms -- around the world."
173,"And that's been called the face area in the brain, because when it's damaged, you can no longer recognize people's faces.

174,"Not because there was not enough food -- because there was actually a surplus of food in the fertile regions of the south parts of the country -- but because in the north, people could not access or entitle themselves to that food. And most of Africa's farmers are, by and large, small farmers in terms of land that they operate, and very, very small farmers in terms of the capital they have at their disposal. And this is not just specific to Ethiopia, but happens over and over, all over Africa. When conditions are right, we know and see that that innovation is ready to explode in rural Africa, just like anywhere else. After having spent more than a decade understanding, studying, and trying to convince policymakers and donors about what was wrong with Africa's agricultural markets, I decided it was time to do something about it. Now, the commodity exchange itself, that concept, is not new to the world. This innovation is at the heart of the transformation of American agriculture, and the rise of Chicago to a global market, agricultural market, superpower from where it was, a small regional town.

175,"Now in the 1980s, I happened to notice that if you look at an aerial photograph of an African village, you see fractals. And of course I had to go to Africa and ask folks why. (Laughter) And so I finally got to this city, and I'd done a little fractal model for the city just to see how it would sort of unfold -- but when I got there, I got to the palace of the chief, and my French is not very good; I said something like, ""I am a mathematician and I would like to stand on your roof."" But he was really cool about it, and he took me up there, and we talked about fractals. Here's one house with the sacred altar, here's the house of houses, the family enclosure, with the humans here where the sacred altar would be, and then here's the village as a whole -- a ring of ring of rings with the chief's extended family here, the chief's immediate family here, and here there's a tiny village only this big. So, when I got to the village, I said, ""Can you take me to the square building? He said, ""Well, if I lived in the jungle, I would only use the long rows of straw because they're very quick and they're very cheap. You can find it on the East Coast as well as the West Coast, and often the symbols are very well preserved, so each of these symbols has four bits -- it's a four-bit binary word -- you draw these lines in the sand randomly, and then you count off, and if it's an odd number, you put down one stroke, and if it's an even number, you put down two strokes.

176,"They go out, they get the food, they dig the nest, and the queen never comes out again. And then this is how colony size and numbers of worker ants changes -- so this is about 10,000 worker ants -- changes as a function of colony age, in years. That's not just how is the colony organized, but how does it change what it's doing? So you see the nest maintenance workers come out with a bit of sand, put it down, turn around, and go back in. So just to reinforce that what you might have thought about ant queens isn't true -- you know, even if the queen did have the intelligence to send chemical messages through this whole network of chambers to tell the ants outside what to do, there is no way that such messages could make it in time to see the shifts in the allocation of workers that we actually see outside the nest. And what I wanted to know was, ""OK, here's a situation where extra nest maintenance workers were recruited -- is this going to have any effect on the workers performing other tasks?"" So, for example, when there's extra nest maintenance work to do, it's not that the foragers switch over. And what we're learning is that an ant uses the pattern of its antennal contacts, the rate at which it meets ants of other tasks, in deciding what to do. They've gone out to do different tasks, and the rate at which they meet as they come in and out of the nest entrance determines, or influences, each ant's decision about whether to go out, and which task to perform.

178,"I then went on to make more comments on the media and press imagery, so I started making reference to media imagery -- made it grainy, shot through doorways and so on and so forth -- to titillate the public or the viewer further in terms of trying to make the viewer more aware of their own voyeurism. So, this is an image of Diana looking at Camilla kissing her husband, and this was a sequence of images. This is Jane Smith and Jo Bloggs, for instance, but you think it's Camilla and the Queen, and I'm fascinated how what you think is real isn't necessarily real. And that is the way, I think, that celebrity magazines work now: the more pictures you see of these celebrities, the more you feel you know them, but you don't know them and you want to know them further. And then I was sort of making imagery. Which I found very interesting that it was going full cycle: I was making comments about the press and about how we know facts and information only by media -- because we don't know the real people; very few of us know the real people -- but it was going back into the press and they were publicizing, effectively, my filthy work.

In 1920, for example, you weren't allowed to drink; if you were a woman, you weren't allowed to vote; and if you looked up at the stars and the Milky Way on a summer night, what you saw was thought to be the entire universe. We see alien worlds, we see alien solar systems -- 300 now, and still counting -- and they're not like us. And in telling stories, each of us is going to understand the universe in our own way. Before I introduce the person responsible for the WorldWide Telescope, I just want to leave you with this brief thought: when I ask people, ""How does the night sky make you feel?"" And thanks to the creators of the WorldWide Telescope, we can now start to have a dialogue with the universe. (Applause) I can't tell you what a privilege it is to introduce Curtis Wong from Microsoft. And the tours are all totally interactive, so that if I were to go somewhere ... you may be watching a tour and you can pause anywhere along the way, pull up other information -- there are lots of Web and information sources about places you might want to go -- you can zoom in, you can pull back out.","in a few months, the world is going to celebrate the launch of a new invention from Microsoft Research. it's called the WorldWide Telescope, and i want to thank TED and Microsoft for allowing me to bring it to your attention. it's going to change the way we do astronomy, it's going to change the way we teach astronomy.","Educator Roy Gould and researcher Curtis Wong show a sneak preview of Microsoft's WorldWide Telescope, which compiles images from telescopes and satellites to build a comprehensive, interactive view of our universe."
181,"At the end of lunch, they untie the anchor, they set off through the Baths of Caracalla and over the walls of the city and then an abandoned gatehouse and decide to take one more look at the Pyramid of Cestius, which has this lightning rod on top. Unfortunately, that's a problem: they get a little too close, and when you're in a dirigible you have to be very careful about spikes. So I thought, well, I'll just do piazzas, and I'll get inside and underneath and I'll show these things growing and show why they're shaped the way they are and so on. I could peel out a page of this palazzo to show you what's going on inside of it. OK, if I don't open the book the whole way, if I just open it 90 degrees, we're looking down the front of the Pantheon, and we're looking sort of at the top, more or less down on the square. But it would be a journey that went through Rome and showed all the things that I like about Rome. So it's a homeless pigeon now and it's going to have to find another place to live, and that allows me to go through my catalog of favorite things, and we start with the tall ones and so on. So, these are all title pages that eventually led me to the solution I settled on, which is the story of a young woman who sends a message on a homing pigeon -- she lives outside the walls of the city of Rome -- to someone in the city. If you see the red line, you are seeing the trail of the pigeon; if you don't see the red line, you are the pigeon. And then we can swoop inside and around; and because we're flying, we don't really have to worry about gravity at this particular moment in time, so this drawing can be oriented in any way on the page.","a young woman sends a message on a homing pigeon to someone in the city of Rome. if you see the red line, you are the trail of the pigeon; if you don't see the red line, you are the pigeon. because we're flying, we don't really have to worry about gravity at this particular moment in time.","David Macaulay relives the winding and sometimes surreal journey toward the completion of Rome Antics, his illustrated homage to the historic city."
182,"We have a grammar that suggests that's who we are; that we are sovereign subjects in nature, the bee as well as me. And that's when I got the idea, which was, ""Well, what would happen if we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who are working on us?"" And I realized that in the same way you can look at a flower and deduce all sorts of interesting things about the taste and the desires of bees -- that they like sweetness, that they like this color and not that color, that they like symmetry -- what could we find out about ourselves by doing the same thing? (Laughter) We have this intellectual, this Darwinian revolution in which, thanks to Darwin, we figured out we are just one species among many; evolution is working on us the same way it's working on all the others; we are acted upon as well as acting; we are really in the fiber, the fabric of life. So when you look at the plants, you realize that there are other tools and they're just as interesting. And I'm going to take you to a farm right now, because I used this idea to develop my understanding of the food system and what I learned, in fact, is that we are all, now, being manipulated by corn. Let me take you to a very different kind of farm. And this is a lot more than growing food, as you'll see; this is a different way to think about nature and a way to get away from the zero-sum notion, the Cartesian idea that either nature's winning or we're winning, and that for us to get what we want, nature is diminished. And what I realized when I understood this -- and if you ask Joel Salatin what he is, he'll tell you he's not a chicken farmer, he's not a sheep farmer, he's not a cattle rancher; he's a grass farmer, because grass is really the keystone species of such a system -- is that, if you think about it, this completely contradicts the tragic idea of nature we hold in our heads, which is that for us to get what we want, nature is diminished. And what it tells you is that if you begin to take account of other species, take account of the soil, that even with nothing more than this perspectival idea -- because there is no technology involved here except for those fences, which are so cheap they could be all over Africa in no time -- that we can take the food we need from the Earth and actually heal the Earth in the process.","gene seymour: we are all, now, being manipulated by corn. he says this is a different way to think about nature and a way to get away from zero-sum notion. seymour: it contradicts tragic idea of nature we hold in our heads that for us to get what we want, nature is diminished.",What if human consciousness isn't the end-all and be-all of Darwinism?

184,"Not only do I have a fleet of cars available to me in seven cities around the world that I can have at my beck and call, but heaven forbid I would ever maintain or deal with the repair or have anything to do with it. So, what is the social result of this? You know it's going to really transform how we feel about travel, and it will also, I think, enhance our freedom of mobility. And it's the cost of driving that's making people want to be able to do this. In London, the day they turned the congestion pricing on, there was a 25 percent decrease in congestion overnight, and that's persisted for the four years in which they've been doing congestion pricing. And as we get our cars more fuel-efficient, that's going to be reducing the amount of revenue that you get off of those gas taxes, so we need to charge people by the mile that they drive. When are we going to do it? Are we going to wait 10 to 15 years for this to happen or are we going to finally have this political will to make it happen in the next two years? So, the examples that I gave you are these islands of mesh networks, and networks are interesting only as they are big.

185,"We're actually starting at a new point: we've been digitizing biology, and now we're trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthesizing life. This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, that has the smallest genome for a species that can self-replicate in the laboratory, and we've been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome. We're able to knock out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here. There are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of DNA -- 30 to 50 letters in length -- and it's a degenerate process, so the longer you make the piece, the more errors there are. Part of the design is designing pieces that are 50 letters long that have to overlap with all the other 50-letter pieces to build smaller subunits we have to design so they can go together. And we started making pieces, starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7,000 letters, put those together to make 24,000-letter pieces, then put sets of those going up to 72,000. With bacteria and Archaea, the chromosome is integrated into the cell, but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it. Now I've argued, this is not genesis; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution. We're about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years. We now, from our discovery around the world, have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think of these as the design components of the future.","we've been digitizing biology, and now we're trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology. we're about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years. we now have a database with about 20 million genes, and we think of them as the design components of the future.","""Can we create new life out of our digital universe?""

186,"How do you discover the uniqueness of a project as unique as a person? And so I'll take you to Wichita, Kansas, where I was asked some years ago to do a science museum on a site, right downtown by the river. (Laughter) And so the process began and they said, ""You can't put it all on an island; some of it has to be on the mainland because we don't want to turn our back to the community."" It was, what I would say, compositional complexity, and I felt that if I had to fulfill what I talked about -- a building for science -- there had to be some kind of a generating idea, some kind of a generating geometry. I worked on it for months and I couldn't deal with it because I felt people were coming out of the historic museum, they are totally saturated with information and to see yet another museum with information, it would make them just unable to digest. And as you come from the north, it is all masonry growing out of the sand cliffs as you come from the Himalayas and evoking the tradition of the fortress. And all of it, then, all the galleries are underground, and you see the openings for the light. That too was a competition, and it is something I'm just beginning to work on. If it were to be anywhere in Washington, it would be an office building, a conference center, a place for negotiating peace and so on -- all of which the building is -- but by virtue of the choice of putting it on the Mall and by the Lincoln Memorial, this becomes the structure that is the symbol of peace on the Mall. And what I felt about that building is that it really was a building that had to do with a lightness of being -- to quote Kundera -- that it had to do with whiteness, it had to do with a certain dynamic quality and it had to do with optimism.","a science museum in wichita, kansas, is the symbol of peace on the mall. curator: ""it really was a building that had to do with a certain dynamic quality and it had to do with optimism"" curator: ""it's a building that has to do with a certain dynamic quality and it had to do with optimism""","Looking back over his long career, architect Moshe Safdie delves into four of his design projects and explains how he labored to make each one truly unique for its site and its users."

(Tones) So basically, with both of your hands you're controlling pitch and volume and kind of trying to create the illusion that you're doing separate notes, when really it's continuously going ...

(Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo) (Laughter) It's kind of a funny, goofy sound to do. And sometimes if I have too much coffee, then my vibrato gets out of hand. It reminds me of the balancing act earlier on -- what Michael was doing -- because you're fighting so hard to keep the balance with what you're playing with and stay in tune, and at the same time you don't want to focus so much on being in tune all the time; you want to be feeling the music. And then also, you're trying to stay very, very, very still because little movements with other parts of your body will affect the pitch, or sometimes if you're holding a low note -- (Tone rising out of key) -- and breathing will make it ... (Laughter)  If I pass out on the next song ... (Laughter) I think of it almost like like a yoga instrument because it makes you so aware of every little crazy thing your body is doing, or just aware of what you don't want it to be doing while you're playing; you don't want to have any sudden movements. It really does reflect the mood that you're in also, if you're ... it's similar to being a vocalist, except instead of it coming out of your throat, you're controlling it just in the air and you don't really have a point of reference; you're always relying on your ears and adjusting constantly.

Song: Before God destroyed the people on the Earth, he warned Noah to build an Ark. And when Noah had done built his Ark, I understand that somebody began to rend a song. And then he went and knocked an old lady house. And old lady ran to the door and say, ""Who is it?"" Because we’re far from home, we’re very tired.""

Information, in the form of energy, streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like, what this present moment smells like and tastes like, what it feels like and what it sounds like. I am an energy-being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere. And this was the portion of my brain that I lost on the morning of my stroke. And then it just gripped me -- and then it released me. I felt at one with all the energy that was, and it was beautiful there. (Laughter) So it's like, ""OK, I've got a problem.""

200,"So here, I have my computer set up with the projector, and I have a Wii Remote sitting on top of it. And, for example, if you're in a school that doesn't have a lot money, probably a lot of schools, or if you're in an office environment, and you want an interactive whiteboard, normally these cost about two to three thousand dollars. Now, what this means is that if I run this piece of software, the camera sees the infrared dot, and I can register the location of the camera pixels to the projector pixels. (Applause) So for about $50 of hardware, you can have your own whiteboard. (Laughter) The software for this I've actually put on my website and have let people download it for free. (Applause) For the second demo, I have this Wii Remote that's actually next to the TV. And why this is interesting is that if you put on, say, a pair of safety glasses, that have two infrared dots in them, they are going to give the computer an approximation of your head location. But if we turn on head tracking -- the computer can change the image that's on the screen and make it respond to the head movements. (Laughter) (Applause) So this has actually been a little bit startling to the game-development community. (Laughter) Because this is about 10 dollars of additional hardware if you already have a Nintendo Wii.","for about $50 of hardware, you can have your own interactive whiteboard. if you put on safety glasses, the infrared dots will give the computer an approximation of your head location. if you turn on head tracking, the computer can change the image that's on the screen.","Building sophisticated educational tools out of cheap parts, Johnny Lee demos his cool Wii Remote hacks, which turn the $40 video game controller into a digital whiteboard, a touchscreen and a head-mounted 3-D viewer."

204,"I mean, all the projects which have, in some way, been inspired by that agenda are about a celebratory lifestyle, in a way celebrating the places and the spaces which determine the quality of life. And I think it was July 20, 1969, when, for the first time, man could look back at planet Earth. So the problems of sustainability cannot be separated from the nature of the cities, of which the buildings are a part. If I pull back from that global picture, and I look at the implication over a similar period of time in terms of the technology -- which, as a tool, is a tool for designers, and I cite our own experience as a company, and I just illustrate that by a small selection of projects -- then how do you measure that change of technology? The image at the top, what it doesn't -- if you look at it in detail, really what it is saying is you can wire this building. And what they were saying on this occasion was that our competitors had to build new buildings for the new technology. In other words, we didn't have the technology to do what would be really interesting on that building. Obviously the wind tunnel had a place, but the ability now with the computer to explore, to plan, to see how that would work in terms of the forces of nature: natural ventilation, to be able to model the chamber below, and to look at biomass. But again, very much about the lifestyle, the quality -- something that would be more enjoyable as a place to work. But what it shows first, which I think is quite interesting, is that here you see the circle, you see the public space around it.","all the projects which have been inspired by that agenda are about a celebratory lifestyle. for the first time, man could look back at planet earth on July 20, 1969. we didn't have the technology to do what would be really interesting on that building.","Architect Norman Foster discusses his own work to show how computers can help architects design buildings that are green, beautiful and ""basically pollution-free.""

We've collapsed that through technology to milliseconds, and that allows us to let Peter to look at his brain in real time as he's inside the scanner. This is a fourth alternative that you are soon going to have. If we can look at the activation in the brain that's producing the pain, we can form 3D models and watch in real time the brain process information, and then we can select the areas that produce the pain. Now imagine that you will soon be able to look inside your brain and select brain areas to do that same thing. As they do it, in the upper left is a display that's yoked to their brain activation of their own pain being controlled. When you do, what do you want to control?

206,"And I'm also rather surprised, because when I look back on my life the last thing I ever wanted to do was write, or be in any way involved in religion. And it has been the study of other religious traditions that brought me back to a sense of what religion can be, and actually enabled me to look at my own faith in a different light.

And we are living in a world that is -- where religion has been hijacked.

207,"But music is even more powerful if you don't just listen to it, but you make it yourself. And I'd add to that, that it's not just making it, but everybody, each of us, everybody in the world has the power to create and be part of music in a very dynamic way, and that's one of the main parts of my work. We have a long-term project called Toy Symphony, where we make all kinds of instruments that are also addictive, but for little kids, so the kids will fall in love with making music, want to spend their time doing it, and then will demand to know how it works, how to make more, how to create. The third idea I want to share with you is that music, paradoxically, I think even more than words, is one of the very best ways we have of showing who we really are. I think that's true for many of us, and I want to give you two examples of how music is one of the most powerful interfaces we have, from ourselves to the outside world. And the opera is about what we can share, what we can pass on to others, to the people we love, and what we can't.

208,"And all I'm going to try and prove to you with these slides is that I do just very straight stuff. (Laughter) The piece on the left -- and that ultimately led to the piece on the right -- happened when the kid that was working on this took one of those long strings of stuff and folded it up to put it in the wastebasket. I went into the metal because it was a way of building a building that was a sculpture. That big metal thing is a passage, and in it is -- you go downstairs into the living room and then down into the bedroom, which is on the right. And a long time ago, about '82 or something, after my house -- I designed a house for myself that would be a village of several pavilions around a courtyard -- and the owner of this lot worked for me and built that actual model on the left.

211,"Is this the face of Leonardo da Vinci or isn't it? His contemporaries made faces, like the ones you see here -- en face or three-quarters. I think that if we were to scan all of his work and look for self-portraits, we would find his face looking at us. There are about 120, you see them here. And we know from his contemporaries that Leonardo was a very handsome, even beautiful man. All we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self-portrait, and look, they are very similar. And as you see here from the years that they were created, it is indeed the case. So we have three pictures, potentially of the same person of the same age as Leonardo at the time. And if we now compare the face of the statue, with the face of the musician, you see the very same features again.

213,"And that's what I want to talk about today, and how that relates to the emergence of social production. What this means is that for the first time since the industrial revolution, the most important means, the most important components of the core economic activities -- remember, we are in an information economy -- of the most advanced economies, and there more than anywhere else, are in the hands of the population at large. One was a motley collection of volunteers who just decided, you know, we really need this, we should write one, and what are we going to do with what -- well, we're gonna share it! So, NASA, at some point, did an experiment where they took images of Mars that they were mapping, and they said, instead of having three or four fully trained Ph.D.s doing this all the time, let's break it up into small components, put it up on the Web, and see if people, using a very simple interface, will actually spend five minutes here, 10 minutes there, clicking. This is what you'll find out about Barbie. This, on the other hand, is what 60,000 passionate volunteers produce in the Open Directory Project, each one willing to spend an hour or two on something they really care about, to say, this is good. When you think of what is the critical innovation of Google, the critical innovation is outsourcing the one most important thing -- the decision about what's relevant -- to the community of the Web as a whole, doing whatever they want to do: so, page rank. But it's not the only one. It is about the future of the freedom to be as social beings with each other, and the way information, knowledge and culture will be produced. Because it is in this context that we see a battle over how easy or hard it will be for the industrial information economy to simply go on as it goes, or for the new model of production to begin to develop alongside that industrial model, and change the way we begin to see the world and report what it is that we see.","for the first time since the industrial revolution, the most important means are in the hands of the population at large. a battle over how easy or hard it will be for the industrial information economy to go on as it goes. google's critical innovation is outsourcing the decision about what's relevant to the community of the Web as a whole.",Yochai Benkler explains how collaborative projects like Wikipedia and Linux represent the next stage of human organization.
214,"And then I'll come back to the beginning, and tell you a little bit more -- hopefully convince you -- that I believe that in today's world, it is really important for business leaders not only to have an idea of what their business is all about, but to have a passion for something that is meaningful. But one of the things that exposed me early to learning, and a tremendous curiosity that was instilled in me as a child, was through a technology which is on the screen -- is a Victrola. So, when you look at that, we said, well, we would like to, then, enable that a little bit. And a couple of years ago at AMD, we came up with this idea of saying, what if we create this initiative we call 50x15, where we are going to aim, that by the year 2015, half of the world will be connected to the Internet so that people and ideas can get connected. And when we embarked in this initiative, from the very beginning we said it very clearly: this is not a charity. What I mean by that, and let me use this example, the country of South Africa, because I was just there, therefore I'm a little bit familiar with some of the challenges they have.

And there's the terrible and dreaded observer effect, in which you're looking for something, and you know, things are happening simultaneously, and you're looking at it in a different way, and you're trying to really look for the about-ness, or what is this story about.

This is that piece installed in a gallery in New York -- those are my parents looking at the piece. And the reason that I do this, it's because I have this fear that we aren't feeling enough as a culture right now. We've lost our sense of outrage, our anger and our grief about what's going on in our culture right now, what's going on in our country, the atrocities that are being committed in our names around the world. And one of the causes of this, I think, is that as each of us attempts to build this new kind of worldview, this holoptical worldview, this holographic image that we're all trying to create in our mind of the interconnection of things: the environmental footprints 1,000 miles away of the things that we buy; the social consequences 10,000 miles away of the daily decisions that we make as consumers. Because my belief is, if we can feel these issues, if we can feel these things more deeply, then they'll matter to us more than they do now. And if there are things that we see that we don't like about our culture, then we have a choice. The degree of integrity that each of us can bring to the surface, to bring to this question, the depth of character that we can summon, as we show up for the question of how do we change -- it's already defining us as individuals and as a nation, and it will continue to do that, on into the future.

226,"So first of all, I'd like to say something about memetics and the theory of memes, and secondly, how this might answer questions about who's out there, if indeed anyone is. What Darwin said was something like this: if you have creatures that vary, and that can't be doubted -- I've been to the Galapagos, and I've measured the size of the beaks and the size of the turtle shells and so on, and so on. If there's something that is copied with variation and it's selected, then you must get design appearing out of nowhere. Now, what's this to do with memes? SB: Sink, toilet, yes, these are all memes, they're all memes, but they're sort of useful ones, and then there's this one. (Laughter) What is this all about? So, you get an arms race between the genes which are trying to get the humans to have small economical brains and not waste their time copying all this stuff, and the memes themselves, like the sounds that people made and copied -- in other words, what turned out to be language -- competing to get the brains to get bigger and bigger. We have a new kind of memes now. We put the storage of memes out there on a clay tablet, but in order to get true temes and true teme machines, you need to get the variation, the selection and the copying, all done outside of humans. I have no idea.","the theory of memes might answer questions about who's out there, if indeed anyone is. we have a new kind of memes now. we need to get the variation, selection and copying, all done outside of humans.","Susan Blackmore studies memes: ideas that replicate themselves from brain to brain like a virus.

227,"(Laughter) So this is a vending machine for crows. (Laughter) And after 10 years of this, my wife said, ""You've got to do this thing you've been talking about, and build the vending machine."" But part of the reason I found this interesting is, I started noticing that we're very aware of all the species that are going extinct on the planet as a result of human habitation expansion, and no one seems to be paying attention to all the species that are actually living; they're surviving. And as I started looking at them, I was finding that they had hyper-adapted. But what was really interesting to me was to find out that the birds were adapting in a pretty unusual way. Then they leave, the machine spits up more coins and peanuts, and life is dandy if you're a crow -- you can come back anytime and get yourself a peanut. So when they get really used to that, we move on to the crows coming back. Now they're used to the sound of the machine; they keep coming back and digging out peanuts from the pile of coins that's there. The crows learn that all they have to do is show up, wait for the coin to come out, put it in the slot, then get their peanut. So, what's significant about this to me isn't that we can train crows to pick up peanuts.","a vending machine is being built for crows to get peanuts from piles of coins. crows learn to wait for coin to come out, put it in slot, then get their peanut. crows are adapting in a pretty unusual way, author says.","Hacker and writer Joshua Klein is fascinated by crows.

228,"And this is one that I did, probably like when I was around seventh grade, and I remember when I was doing this, I was thinking about that little rock there, and the pathway of the vehicles as they would fly through the air, and how the characters -- (Laughter) -- would come shooting out of the car, so, on my mind, I was thinking about the trajectory of the vehicles. (Laughter) The next piece that is going to come up is an example of a kind of machine that is fairly complex. And because the wishbone is bone -- it's animal -- it's sort of a point where I think we can enter into it. And -- so the way I saw this in my mind at first, was that the pieces would explode up and out with infinite speed, and the pieces would move far out, and then they would begin to be pulled back with a kind of a gravitational feel, to the point where they would approach infinite speed back to the center. There are 12 pairs of 50:1 reductions, so that means that the final speed of that gear on the end is so slow that it would take two trillion years to turn once. (Laughter) (Applause) And it's really, just sort of -- for me, it was just really about the lusciousness of oil. (Laughter) And that was that tool.

229,"So he thought, ""I don't know anything about science, but I do know something about data, so maybe I should go and look at the data and see whether this expensive and complicated treatment actually works any better than the cheap and simple one."" And lo and behold, when he went through the data, he found that it didn't look like the expensive, complicated solution was any better than the cheap one, at least for the children who were two and older -- the cheap one still didn't work on the kids who were younger. And the other logic, they say, ""Well, the government wouldn't have told us [to] use them if they weren't much better."" Here, they don't actually crash the entire car, you know -- it's not worth ruining a whole car to do it. It's hard to believe, when you look at this, that that kid in back is going to do very well when you get in a crash. So here -- this is the car seat. And this crash would have been about a 450. The funny thing is, the cam work is terrible because they've only set it up to do the car seats, and so, they actually don't even have a way to move the camera so you can see the kid that's on the rebound. And I just think that it's interesting that the idea of using real-world crashes, which is very much something that economists think would be the right thing to do, is something that scientists don't actually, usually think -- they would rather use a laboratory, a very imperfect science of looking at the dummies, than actually 30 years of data of what we've seen with children and with car seats.

It wasn't what I wanted to do. So, all of these projects have a humanistic sense to them, and I think as designers we need to really think about how we can create a different relationship between our work and the world, whether it's for business, or, as I'm going to show, on some civic-type projects.

It was a really neat idea, and I'll get to why it didn't work, but here's how it works. The ammonia evaporates and it recondenses in the other side. So it was a great idea that didn't work at all. So the great thing about 2006, there's a lot of really great computational work you can do. We proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong.

And where we go from here is going to determine not only the quality and the length of our individual lives, but whether, if we could see the Earth a century from now, we'd recognize it. There's more. Our demand for meat, dairy and refined carbohydrates -- the world consumes one billion cans or bottles of Coke a day -- our demand for these things, not our need, our want, drives us to consume way more calories than are good for us. Now, there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here, but the evidence is that plants -- and I want to make this clear -- it's not the ingredients in plants, it's the plants. One: we don't need either of them for health. But there's no way to treat animals well, when you're killing 10 billion of them a year. Not that they were any good, but they were there.

242,"So, I'd like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions. But Einstein realized that Newton had left something out of the story, because even Newton had written that although he understood how to calculate the effect of gravity, he'd been unable to figure out how it really works. Number one: if there are more dimensions in space, where are they? And the idea that maybe the big dimensions around us are the ones that we can easily see, but there might be additional dimensions curled up, sort of like the circular part of that cable, so small that they have so far remained invisible. Some of you guys will fix that one day, but anything that's not flat on a screen is a new dimension, goes smaller, smaller, smaller, and way down in the microscopic depths of space itself, this is the idea, you could have additional curled up dimensions -- here is a little shape of a circle -- so small that we don't see them. Well, it turns out that Einstein and Kaluza and many others worked on trying to refine this framework and apply it to the physics of the universe as was understood at the time, and, in detail, it didn't work. The idea is like this. (Laughter) But it raises the question: are we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions, or do they tell us something about the world? So when we talk about the extra dimensions in string theory, it's not one extra dimension, as in the older ideas of Kaluza and Klein. And the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like, then the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us would look like this on the tiniest of scales.","jay parini: Einstein realized that Newton had left something out of the story. parini: if there are more dimensions in space, where are they? he says it raises the question: are we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions, or do they tell us something? parini: if the extra dimensions look like this, the landscape of our universe would look like this.","Physicist Brian Greene explains superstring theory, the idea that minscule strands of energy vibrating in 11 dimensions create every particle and force in the universe."

This was first discovered in 1859. Some of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms. (Applause) I then think that we can make the argument that we should save the old-growth forest as a matter of national defense. So, I went to the EPA homepage, and they were recommending studies with metarhizium species of a group of fungi that kill carpenter ants, as well as termites. These are spores -- this is in their spores. But the insects aren't stupid, and they would avoid the spores when they came close, and so I morphed the cultures into a non-sporulating form. I then received my second patent -- and this is a big one. These are a species that we need to join with.","john avlon: fungi kill carpenter ants, termites, carpenter ants. avlon: he morphed the cultures into a non-sporulating form. avlon: fungi are a species that we need to join with.","Mycologist Paul Stamets lists 6 ways the mycelium fungus can help save the universe: cleaning polluted soil, making insecticides, treating smallpox and even flu viruses."
244,"Now I put those names in there just for the bacteria buffs, but the main point here is that -- (Laughter) there's a lot of them here, I can tell -- the main point here is that those data points all show a very strong, positive association between the degree to which a disease organism is transmitted by water, and how harmful they are, how much death they cause per untreated infection. Other countries, in which you've got a lot of waterborne transmission, there you expect these organisms to evolve towards a high level of harmfulness, right? Just to emphasize this, this is what we're really talking about. Now, I don't know how that happened, and I didn't have anything to do with it, I promise you. And to just give you a sense of how important this might be, if we look in 1995, we find that there's only one case of cholera, on average, reported from Chile every two years. And the example I want to deal with is, or the idea I want to deal with, the question is, what can we do to try to get the malarial organism to evolve to mildness? So, if you were to mosquito proof houses, you should be able to get these organisms to evolve to mildness. And all I'm saying is that we need to figure out how they'll evolve, so that -- we need to adjust our interventions to get the most bang for the intervention buck, so that we can get these organisms to evolve in the direction we want them to go. So, I don't really have time to talk about those things, but I did want to put them up there, just to give you a sense that there really are solutions to controlling the evolution of harmfulness of some of the nasty pathogens that we're confronted with. If we know that we're going to get extra bang for the buck from providing clean water, then I think that we can say, let's push the effort into that aspect of the control, so that we can actually solve the problem, even though, if you just look at the frequency of infection, you would suggest that you can't solve the problem well enough just by cleaning up water supply.","there's only one case of cholera, on average, reported from Chile every two years. we need to adjust our interventions to get the most bang for the buck. if we know that we're going to get extra bang for the buck from providing clean water.","Evolutionary biologist Paul Ewald drags us into the sewer to discuss germs.

251,"I want to talk about something quite different, which is what I know about, and that is astronomy. Particularly, there's a place called Europa, which is -- Europa is one of the moons of Jupiter, where we see a very level ice surface, which looks as if it's floating on top of an ocean. There is a -- imagine that life originated on Europa, and it was sitting in the ocean for billions of years. So they would have to have -- these creatures, which I call sunflowers, which I imagine living on the surface of Europa, would have to have either lenses or mirrors to concentrate sunlight, so they could keep themselves warm on the surface. Of course, it's not very likely that there's life on the surface of Europa. So, the same thing could be true for this kind of life, which I'm talking about, on cold objects: that it could in fact be very abundant all over the universe, and it's not been detected just because we haven't taken the trouble to look. And then, when you shine sunlight at them, the sunlight will be reflected back, just as it is in the eyes of an animal. And the further out you go in this, away from the Sun, the more powerful this reflection will be. But if you live in a vacuum, if you live on the surface of one of these objects, say, in the Kuiper Belt, this -- an object like Pluto, or one of the smaller objects in the neighborhood of Pluto, and you happened -- if you're living on the surface there, and you get knocked off the surface by a collision, then it doesn't change anything all that much. We can -- as soon as we have a little bit more understanding of genetic engineering, one of the things you can do with your take-it-home, do-it-yourself genetic engineering kit -- (Laughter) -- is to design a creature that can live on a cold satellite, a place like Europa, so we could colonize Europa with our own creatures.","a place called Europa is one of the moons of Jupiter. it's not very likely that there's life on the surface of Europa. we could design a creature that can live on a cold satellite, a place like Europa.","Physicist Freeman Dyson suggests that we start looking for life on the moons of Jupiter and out past Neptune, in the Kuiper belt and the Oort cloud.

258,"And we've had a classic answer for coordination costs, which is, if you want to coordinate the work of a group of people, you start an institution, right? More recently, because the cost of letting groups communicate with each other has fallen through the floor -- and communication costs are one of the big inputs to coordination -- there has been a second answer, which is to put the cooperation into the infrastructure, to design systems that coordinate the output of the group as a by-product of the operating of the system, without regard to institutional models. So, I'm going to start by trying to answer a question that I know each of you will have asked yourself at some point or other, and which the Internet is purpose-built to answer, which is, where can I get a picture of a roller-skating mermaid? You can see here, over at the end, our most prolific photographer has taken around 350 photos, and you can see there's a few people who have taken hundreds of photos. The institutional response is, I can get 75 percent of the value for 10 percent of the hires -- great, that's what I'll do. You can hire those people as employees, you can coordinate their work and you can get some output. The bigger question is, what do you do about the value down here? I've used a lot of examples from Flickr, but there are actually stories about this from all over. So as much as we want the shield laws, the background -- the institution to which they were attached -- is becoming incoherent.

The point is that everything will have embedded in it some sensor connecting it to the machine, and so we have, basically, an Internet of things. And if you remember, it was a kind of green screen with cursors, and there was really not much to do, and if you wanted to connect it, you connected it from one computer to another computer. Each time you go into there, you have to tell it again who you are and all your friends are. And all these things that are going to be on this are not just pages, they are things.

260,"And I think that's what I'd like to talk about today. But any kind of conversation about architecture -- which is, in fact, what you were just talking about, what was going on here, setting up TED, small-scale architecture -- at the present time can't really happen without a conversation about this, the World Trade Center, and what's been going on there, what it means to us. I think that the World Trade Center in, rather an unfortunate way, brought architecture into focus in a way that I don't think people had thought of in a long time, and made it a subject for common conversation. And so now we're going to think about architecture in a very different way, we're going to think about it like this. There it is. And so we got this, or we had a choice of that. Now, I don't know what you think, but I think this is a pretty stupid decision, because what you've done is just made a permanent memorial to destruction by making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever. And that is the wild divergence in how we choose our architects, in trying to decide whether we want architecture from the kind of technocratic solution to everything -- that there is a large, technical answer that can solve all problems, be they social, be they physical, be they chemical -- or something that's more of a romantic solution. Meanwhile, instead of sending someone working drawings, which are those huge sets of blueprints that you've seen your whole life, what the architect can do is send a set of assembly instructions, like you used to get when you were a child, when you bought little models that said, ""Bolt A to B, and C to D."" And so what the builder will get is every single individual part that has been custom manufactured off-site and delivered on a truck to the site, to that builder, and a set of these instruction manuals. It's not to create a technological solution, it's to seduce you into something that you can do, into something that will please you, something that will lift your spirits, something that will make you feel as if are in another world -- such as his Nobu restaurant in New York, which is supposed to take you from the clutter of New York City to the simplicity of Japan and the elegance of Japanese tradition.","the world trade center brought architecture into focus in a way no one had thought of in a long time. aaron carroll: we're going to think about architecture like this, or we had a choice of that. he says it's a wild divergence in how we choose our architects. carroll: architecture is not to create a technocratic solution, it's to seduce you.","Reed Kroloff gives us a new lens for judging new architecture: is it modern, or is it romantic?

263,"In fact, this dark matter dominates the gravitational effects in the universe on a large scale, and I'll be telling you about the evidence for that. As you can imagine, even if you know physics, this should be intuitive, OK -- that stars that are closer to the mass in the middle will be rotating at a higher speed than those that are further out here, OK. And again, what we find is that there is much more mass there than can be accounted for by the galaxies that we see. We say, the ray of light came this way; the galaxy must be there, OK. Now, suppose I put in the middle a cluster of galaxies -- and don't forget the dark matter, OK. Now, if we consider a different ray of light, one going off like this, we now need to take into account what Einstein predicted when he developed general relativity. And now put the lens over the galaxy, and what you'll find is that you'll see a ring, an Einstein ring. So the evidence that we have that a quarter of the universe is dark matter -- this gravitationally attracting stuff -- is that galaxies, the speed with which stars orbiting galaxies is much too large; it must be embedded in dark matter. Now, so at this point, then, what I want to really emphasize to you, is that, first of all, dark matter and dark energy are completely different things, OK. Now, we look for these dark matter particles because, after all, they are here in the room, OK, and they didn't come in the door. There's going to be a satellite telescope launched later this year and it will look towards the middle of the galaxy, to see if we can see dark matter particles annihilating and producing gamma rays that could be detected with this.

265,"And so, the question is, why aren't we really seeing this kind of power in computers that we see in the brain? Let's just take a look about how the brain works, and then I'll compare that with how computers work. And that's basically what's going on in your brain right now as you're watching this. In the computer, you have all the data going through the central processing unit, and any piece of data basically has to go through that bottleneck, whereas in the brain, what you have is these neurons, and the data just really flows through a network of connections among the neurons. And then the way that you process that data to get a result is that you translate this pattern of activity into a new pattern of activity, just by it flowing through the network. What you see here is that there's these redundant connections. They want to compress the information -- they just want to send the changes, what's new in the image, and so on -- and that is how your eyeball is able to squeeze all that information down to your optic nerve, to send to the rest of the brain. And this is the same thing you see when people compress video to send: they want to make it very sparse, because that file is smaller. And this is what the retina is doing, and it's doing it just with the circuitry, and how this network of neurons that are interacting in there, which we've captured on the chip. So this image here is going to look like these ones, but here I'll show you that we can reconstruct the image, so, you know, you can almost recognize Kareem in that top part there.","in the computer, you have all the data going through the central processing unit. in the brain, what you have is a network of connections among the neurons. this is how your eyeball is able to squeeze all that information down to your optic nerve.","Researcher Kwabena Boahen is looking for ways to mimic the brain's supercomputing powers in silicon -- because the messy, redundant processes inside our heads actually make for a small, light, superfast computer."

(Laughter) Now, those questions, which, of course, you've got right, and you haven't been conferring, and so on. But, actually, we don't do that. Now, I have some rather bad news, which is that I had a piece of video that I was about to show you, which unfortunately -- the sound doesn't work in this room, so I'm going to describe to you, in true ""Monty Python"" fashion, what happens in the video. But if you haven't played with a battery and a bulb, if you've only seen a circuit diagram, you might not be able to do that, and that's one of the problems. I mean, it's a very strange thing going on, and we hold these two models in our head, of what's right and what isn't right, and we do that, as human beings, in all sorts of fields. And that you don't -- there's no passion in it, and it's not hands on, right, and, you know, pun intended.

270,"So in origami, to obey these laws, we can take simple patterns -- like this repeating pattern of folds, called textures -- and by itself it's nothing. But if we follow the laws of origami, we can put these patterns into another fold that itself might be something very, very simple, but when we put it together, we get something a little different. We take an idea, combine it with a square, and you get an origami figure. And then once I have that folded shape that we call the base, you can make the legs narrower, you can bend them, you can turn it into the finished shape. And I'm going to show you all how to do that so you can go out of here and fold something. Well, if I unfold it and go back to the crease pattern, you can see that the upper left corner of that shape is the paper that went into the flap.

So, what we've done is we've figured out a way to have a molecular program know when to stop going. Here's the DNA origami, and what we can do is we can write 32 on both edges of the DNA origami, and we can now use our watering can and water with tiles, and we can start growing tiles off of that and create a square. If we wanted to make a square of size 10, 100 or 1,000, if we used DNA origami alone, we would require a number of DNA strands that's the square of the size of that square; so we'd need 100, 10,000 or a million DNA strands. But if we use a little computation -- we use origami, plus some tiles that count -- then we can get away with using 100, 200 or 300 DNA strands. If you look at the square that you build with the origami and some counters growing off it, the pattern that it has is exactly the pattern that you need to make a memory. You know, so this is all very cool, but what I'd like you to take from the talk, hopefully from some of those big questions, is that this molecular programming isn't just about making gadgets.","DNA origami is a bunch of double helices that are parallel to each other. scientists have figured out a way to have a molecular program know when to stop. if we wanted to make a square of size 10, 100 or 1,000, if we used DNA origami alone, we would need 100, 10,000 or a million DNA strands.","In 2007, Paul Rothemund gave TED a short summary of his specialty, DNA folding.

So the second stage in training is to teach the dog to want to do what we want him to do, and this is very easy.

287,"The famous ones -- despotism is a good one; anarchy is a way to not deploy the power in any organized way, to do it in a radically diffused fashion; and democracy is a set of technologies, which have the effect of, in principle, diffusing the power source to a large number of people and then re-concentrating it in a smaller group of people who govern, and who themselves are, in principle, authorized to govern by virtue of what the broader public has done. It follows from that that all of the people in the world who say that they are Muslims can, in principle, subscribe to a wide range of different interpretations of what Islam really is, and the same is true of democracy. Fear is not an implausible reaction with a war just around the corner and with a very, very high likelihood that many, many people are going to die as a consequence of this confrontation -- a confrontation which many, many people in the Muslim world do not want, many, many people in the American democracy do not want, many people elsewhere in the world do not want, but which nonetheless is favored by a large enough number of people -- at least in the relevant space, which is the United States -- to actually go forward. Well, all over the Muslim world there are people who take Islam deeply seriously, people who care about Islam, for whom it's a source either of faith, or of civilization, or of deep values, or just a source of powerful personal identity, who think and are saying loudly that Islam and democracy are in fact not in conflict, but are in fact deeply compatible. But now that the Cold War is over, there's nearly universal consensus in the Muslim world -- and pretty close to the same here in the United States, if you talk to people and ask them -- that in principle, there's no reason that democracy and Islam cannot co-exist. Now what I want to suggest to you is that the reason for hope in this case is that we are on the edge of a real transformation in the Muslim world. It will also not look exactly the way either the people in this room, or Muslims out in the rest of the world -- I don't mean to imply there aren't Muslims here, there probably are -- conceptualize Islam. Now, I began with the war because it's the elephant in the room, and you can't pretend that there isn't about to be a war if you're talking about these issues. The war has tremendous risks for the model that I'm describing because it's very possible that as a consequence of a war, many Muslims will conclude that the United States is not the kind of place that they want to emulate with respect to its forms of political government. On the other hand, the capacities for positive results in the aftermath of a war are also not to be underestimated, even by, and I would say especially by, people who are deeply skeptical about whether we should go to war in the first place.","aaron miller: fear is not an implausible reaction with a war just around the corner. miller: there's nearly universal consensus in the Muslim world that democracy and Islam can co-exist. he says we are on the edge of a real transformation in the Muslim world. miller: we need a new way of thinking about the world, not a new way of thinking about it.","Noah Feldman makes a searing case that both politics and religion -- whatever their differences -- are similar technologies, designed to efficiently connect and manage any group of people."

There are a number of reasons to doubt that the human mind is a blank slate, and some of them just come from common sense. There are also, I think, increasing results from the scientific study of humans that, indeed, we're not born blank slates. They are: the arts and parenting. Well, in fact, the arts are not in decline. And here's just one example. Well, the argument in ""The Blank Slate"" was that elite art and criticism in the 20th century, although not the arts in general, have disdained beauty, pleasure, clarity, insight and style. They're useless because they don't control for heritability. You might think, well, then they'd be even more similar, because not only would they share their genes, but they would also share their environment. What it suggests is that children are shaped not by their parents over the long run, but in part -- only in part -- by their genes, in part by their culture -- the culture of the country at large and the children's own culture, namely their peer group -- as we heard from Jill Sobule earlier today, that's what kids care about -- and, to a very large extent, larger than most people are prepared to acknowledge, by chance: chance events in the wiring of the brain in utero; chance events as you live your life.","jeffrey toobin: there are controversies about whether the human mind is a blank slate. toobin: science shows we're not born blank slates, but the arts are not in decline. toobin: kids are shaped not by their parents over the long run, but by their genes. toobin: kids are shaped by their peer group, not by their parents over the long run.","Steven Pinker's book The Blank Slate argues that all humans are born with some innate traits.

So, all the waters of the world are served there, so we thought that, you know, after being at the water and moving through the water and breathing the water, you could also drink this building. In 2003, the Whitney mounted a retrospective of our work that featured a lot of this work from the '80s and '90s. We used the wall to partition the 13 installations of the project and produce a kind of acoustic and visual separation. So, you come in and you're basically squeezed by the theater, by the belly of the theater, into this very compressed space where the view is turned off. And this was really a kind of very important part of this building, and here is a point where architecture -- this is like technology-free -- architecture is only a framing device, it only edits the harbor view, the industrial harbor just through its walls, its floors and its ceiling, to only expose the water itself, the texture of water, much like a hypnotic effect created by electronic snow or a lava lamp or something like that. And here is where we really felt that there was a great convergence of the technological and the natural in the project. So, this is the entrance to Tully Hall as it used to be, before the renovation, which we just started. But what I wanted to do was take a couple of seconds that I have left to just talk about the hall itself, which is kind of where we're really doing a massive amount of work. So now that we've stripped the hall of all visual distraction, everything that prevents this intimacy which is supposed to connect the house, the audience, with the performers, we add one little detail, one piece of architectural excess, a special effect: lighting.","in 2003, the Whitney mounted a retrospective of our work that featured a lot of work from the '80s and '90s. we used the wall to partition the 13 installations of the project and produce a kind of acoustic and visual separation. we added one little detail, one piece of architectural excess, a special effect.","In this engrossing EG talk, architect Liz Diller shares her firm DS+R's more unusual work, including the Blur Building, whose walls are made of fog, and the revamped Alice Tully Hall, which is wrapped in glowing wooden skin."

301,"(Laughter) And one of the thoughts that I had dealing with these two separate emergences of a book and a baby, and having this event happen so close -- that my first thought, when I was still kind of in the apartment looking out at it all or walking out on the street and looking out on it just in front of our building, was that I'd made a terrible miscalculation in the book that I'd just written. And so I started to think, well, you know, density, density -- I'm not sure if, you know, this was the right call. And this is increasingly what we're starting to see on the Web in a bunch of interesting ways -- most of which weren't around, actually, except in very experimental things, when I was writing ""Emergence"" and when the book came out. That is -- you know, there's no sentence that kind of conjures up that period better than that, I think, which is that you suddenly have the power to put up a picture of your dog and link to it, and somebody reading the page has the power to click on that link or not click on that link. Because effectively, what's happening here, what's creating this page, obviously -- and we all know this, but it's worth just thinking about it -- is not some person deciding that I am the number one answer for Steven Johnson, but rather somehow the entire web of people putting up pages and deciding to link to my page or not link to it, and Google just sitting there and running the numbers. Now, what you're having here is basically a global brain that you're able to do lots of kind of experiments on to see what it's thinking.

303,"So why didn't the Greenland Norse as well? And then finally, the fifth item on my checklist is the political, economic, social and cultural factors in the society that make it more or less likely that the society will perceive and solve its environmental problems. In the case of the Greenland Norse, cultural factors that made it difficult for them to solve their problems were: their commitments to a Christian society investing heavily in cathedrals; their being a competitive-ranked chiefly society; and their scorn for the Inuit, from whom they refused to learn. So, I'm looking at these issues of collapses for a lot of past societies and for many present societies. There are many societies that don't wind down gradually, but they build up -- get richer and more powerful -- and then within a short time, within a few decades after their peak, they collapse. A second general theme is that there are many, often subtle environmental factors that make some societies more fragile than others. And within the last couple of years, it's been obvious that the elite in the business world correctly perceive that they can advance their short-term interest by doing things that are good for them but bad for society as a whole, such as draining a few billion dollars out of Enron and other businesses. Well, all of us know the dozen sorts of ticking time bombs going on in the modern world, time bombs that have fuses of a few decades to -- all of them, not more than 50 years, and any one of which can do us in; the time bombs of water, of soil, of climate change, invasive species, the photosynthetic ceiling, population problems, toxics, etc., etc. For example, if we solve our problems of water and soil and population, but don't solve our problems of toxics, then we are in trouble.

304,"I love doing this work, because it really gives many people new hope and new choices that they didn't have before, and it allows us to talk about things that -- not just diet, but that happiness is not -- we're talking about the pursuit of happiness, but when you really look at all the spiritual traditions, what Aldous Huxley called the ""perennial wisdom,"" when you get past the names and forms and rituals that divide people, it's really about -- our nature is to be happy; our nature is to be peaceful, our nature is to be healthy. And so happiness is not something you get, health is generally not something that you get, but rather, all of these different practices -- you know, the ancient swamis and rabbis and priests and monks and nuns didn't develop these techniques to just manage stress or lower your blood pressure or unclog your arteries, even though it can do all those things. And it's not a diet. When I began doing this work 26 or 27 years ago, it was thought that once you have heart disease, it can only get worse. But it's really not natural; we found it could get better and better, and much more quickly than people thought. We also found the more people changed, the better they got. And what we found was that 99 percent of the patients stopped or reversed the progression of their heart disease. And the paradox is that when you make big changes, you get big benefits, and you feel so much better so quickly. The problem is, it's based on this half-truth: Americans eat too many simple carbs, so if you eat fewer, you'll lose weight, and even more weight if you eat whole foods and less fat, and you'll enhance your health rather than harming it. The last thing I want to talk about, apropos of the issue of the pursuit of happiness, is that study after study has shown that people who are lonely and depressed -- and depression is the other real epidemic in our culture -- are many times more likely to get sick and die prematurely, in part because, as we talked about, they're more likely to smoke, overeat, drink too much, work too hard, and so on.","dean obeidallah: we're talking about the pursuit of happiness, but it's not a diet. obeidallah: when you make big changes, you get big benefits, and you feel so much better. he says people who are lonely and depressed are more likely to get sick and die prematurely. obeidallah: if you're depressed, you're more likely to smoke, drink too much, work too hard.","Dean Ornish talks about simple, low-tech and low-cost ways to take advantage of the body's natural desire to heal itself."

You know, there's no way that you can do anything for anyone if you overdo things. So there is a connectivity, and I have to understand that -- as part of the creation, as part of me being made in the image of God. Now there is, in Judaism, a gorgeous story of a rich man who sat in synagogue one day. He said, ""God wants bread. And after the Sabbath, he made 12 loaves of bread, took them to the synagogue, went into the synagogue, opened the ark and said, ""God, I don't know why you want this bread, but here you are."" And he put it in the ark with the scrolls of the Torah. Every week, the man would bring bread with raisins, with all sorts of good things, put it into the ark. ""Of course, what you are doing,"" he said to the rich man, ""is answering God's plea that we should be compassionate. So that is the way I feel: that I can only try to approach this notion of being compassionate, of understanding that there is a connectivity, that there is a unity in this world; that I want to try and serve that unity, and that I can try and do that by understanding, I hope, trying to understand something of the pain of others; but understanding that there are limits, that people have to bear responsibility for some of the problems that come upon them; and that I have to understand that there are limits to my energy, to the giving I can give.","jeffrey toobin: there's no way that you can do anything for anyone if you overdo things. toobin: there's a connectivity, and you have to be aware in such a way that you can help people. he says in judaism, rich man said, ""god, I don't know why you want this bread, but here you are"" toobin: if you want to be compassionate, you have to be aware of the needs of others","While we all agree that compassion is a great idea, Rabbi Tabick acknowledges there are challenges to its execution.

306,"Actually, for the next 18 minutes I'm going to do the best I can to describe the beauty of particle physics without equations. This seems weird to us, because each of us only experiences an individual existence, and we don't get to see other branches. The charges of all known particles can be plotted in a four-dimensional charge space, and projected down to two dimensions like this so we can see them. So there's an old idea in particle physics that this known pattern of charges, which is not very symmetric, could emerge from a more perfect pattern that gets broken -- similar to how the Higgs particle breaks the electroweak pattern to give electromagnetism. It's a very beautiful object, and as with any unification, we can see some holes where new particles are required by this pattern. From their location in this pattern, we know that these new particles should be scalar fields like the Higgs particle, but have color charge and interact with the strong force. (Laughter) Now, how bad would that be? GL: Well, right now the pattern I showed you that corresponds to what we know about elementary particle physics -- that already corresponds to a very beautiful shape.

And it's interesting, if you think about it, how, when we think about the civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement -- whether it's China, Greece, the Hindu civilization, or the Mayas, or Egyptians -- what we know about them is really about their ecstasies, not about their everyday life. Now, this man doesn't need to go to a place like this, which is also -- this place, this arena, which is built like a Greek amphitheatre, is a place for ecstasy also. We are participating in a reality that is different from that of the everyday life that we're used to. You can't understand more than two people talking to you. And because all of these people I started interviewing -- this was an interview which is over 30 years old -- so many of the people described this as a spontaneous flow that I called this type of experience the ""flow experience."" This poet describes it as opening a door that floats in the sky -- a very similar description to what Albert Einstein gave as to how he imagined the forces of relativity, when he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked. And two things that we measure is the amount of challenge people experience at that moment and the amount of skill that they feel they have at that moment. And you may be doing things very differently from other people, but for everyone that flow channel, that area there, will be when you are doing what you really like to do -- play the piano, be with your best friend, perhaps work, if work is what provides flow for you. And that is the kind of challenge that we're trying to understand.","""flow experience"" is a spontaneous experience that is different from everyday life. many people describe it as opening a door that floats in the sky.

314,"But it wasn't simply for office or power or celebrity or fame -- what it was for was to accomplish something worthy enough in life so that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it. The Lyndon Johnson that I saw in the last years of his life, when I helped him on his memoirs, was a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit of work, power and individual success, that he had absolutely no psychic or emotional resources left to get him through the days once the presidency was gone. And because he was so sad and so vulnerable, he opened up to me in ways he never would have had I known him at the height of his power -- sharing his fears, his sorrows and his worries. It was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large that even the love of a family, without work, could not fill it. they said. It all began when I was only six years old, and my father taught me that mysterious art of keeping score while listening to baseball games -- so that when he went to work in New York during the day, I could record for him the history of that afternoon's Brooklyn Dodgers game. I must say, so fervent was my love of the old Brooklyn Dodgers in those days that I had to confess in my first confession two sins that related to baseball. So I had this sin on my soul when I went to my first confession. (Laughter) So he said, ""Look, I'll tell you something.

315,"That is all well and good, but where do we go wrong, and what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world? For the answer to this, we turn to our spiritual path. The famous Sufi master Rumi, who is very well known to most of you, has a story in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend, and he knocks on the door, and a voice answers, ""Who's there?"" In the presence of God, there is no room for more than one ""I,"" and that is the ""I"" of divinity. You want your employees to do what you ask them to do, and if they've done that, then they can do extra. It is this merging of our self with divinity that is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions. That is a moment which is a gift of God to us -- a gift when, for a moment, he lifts that boundary which makes us insist on ""I, I, I, me, me, me,"" and instead, like the person in Rumi's story, we say, ""Oh, this is all you. And us, and I, and us are all part of you. We have access to it all. But all this is for us to glorify the name of the creator whose primary name is the compassionating, the compassionate.","frida ghitis: in the presence of God, there is no room for more than one ""I"" of divinity. ghitis: this merging of our self with divinity is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path. she says when we insist on ""I, I, I, me, me, me,"" he lifts the boundary and gives us access to it all. ghitis: if we want to be compassionate, we need to be compassionate and compassionate.","Imam Faisal Abdul Rauf combines the teachings of the Qur'an, the stories of Rumi, and the examples of Muhammad and Jesus, to demonstrate that only one obstacle stands between each of us and absolute compassion -- ourselves."

(Laughter) But in any case, what I’m going to do in my little bit of time is take you on a quick tour of some of the things that we talk about and we think about. The first science of cosmology that was anything like science was Aristotelian science, and that was hierarchical. Now, in the 17th century there was a revolution in thinking about space and time and motion and so forth of Newton. Now, similarly, in Locke’s society there are individuals who have certain rights, properties in a formal sense, and those are defined with respect to some absolute, abstract notions of rights and justice, and so forth, which are independent of what else has happened in the society. There is also an omniscient observer who knows everything, who is God, who is in a certain sense outside the universe, because he has no role in anything that happens, but is in a certain sense everywhere, because space is just the way that God knows where everything is, according to Newton, OK? And merging them together to make the final quantum theory of space and time and gravity, is the culmination of that, something that’s going on right now. All properties of things are about these kinds of relationships. Because there’s no place to put a maker outside, as there was in the Aristotelian and the Newtonian universe. And what we’ve been working out is the implications, really, of the idea that the universe is made up of relations.","the first science of cosmology that was anything like science was Aristotelian science. in the 17th century there was a revolution in thinking about space and time and motion. there is also an omniscient observer who knows everything, who is God.","Physicist Lee Smolin talks about how the scientific community works: as he puts it, ""we fight and argue as hard as we can,"" but everyone accepts that the next generation of scientists will decide who's right.

But it’s a question of perception, and if that’s what you’re thinking, if that’s what you think I mean when I say, ""This is an ocean planet stupidly called 'Earth.'"" If you think that that’s the relative importance, two to one, you’re wrong by a factor of ten. The problem we have in believing that is -- you just have to give up this notion that this Earth was created for us. If you look at that sub, you’ll see a sphere. It’s what we humans do when we go in the ocean as engineers; we take all our terrestrial hang-ups, all our constraints -- importantly, these two-dimensional constraints that we have, and they’re so constrained we don’t even understand it -- and we take them underwater. What we need to do is go down into the ocean with the freedom of the animals, and move in this three-dimensional space. There I’m coming; she sees me. I wanted you to notice that she actually turned to come back up. The rational for the world’s first flight school goes something like: when the coastguards come up to me and say -- they used to leave us alone when we were diving these goofy little spherical things, but when we started flying around in underwater jet fighters they got a little nervous -- they would come up and say, ""Do you have a license for that?""","bob greene: if you think this is an ocean planet stupidly called 'Earth,' you're wrong by a factor of ten. he says we have to give up notion that this Earth was created for us. greene: we need to go down into the ocean with the freedom of the animals.","Graham Hawkes takes us aboard his graceful, winged submarines to the depths of planet Ocean (a.k.a.

OK, now. So let me explain to you why -- a very simple fact that tells you why this shape theory really does not work very well. This is cis-3-hexene-1-ol. Now, this is kind of interesting, because it tells you that you should be looking for a particular fact, which is this: nothing in the world smells like rotten eggs except S-H, OK? So here you have a system, you have something -- and there’s plenty of that stuff in biology -- some substance giving an electron, and the electron tries to jump, and only when a molecule comes along that has the right vibration does the reaction happen, OK?

322,"Actually, I think the bad news about kin selection is just that it means that this kind of compassion is naturally deployed only within the family. The good news is compassion is natural. Again, I know this is not as inspiring a notion of compassion as you may have heard in the past, but from a biologist's point of view, this reciprocal altruism kind of compassion is ultimately self-serving too. Now, if you've been paying attention, you're probably anticipating that there's bad news here; we still aren't to universal love, and it's true because, although an appreciation of the golden rule is natural, it's also natural to carve out exceptions to the golden rule. And the problem is that -- although in the case of sending people to prison, you have this impartial judiciary determining who gets excluded from the golden rule -- that in everyday life, the way we all make these decisions about who we're not going to extend the golden rule to, is we use a much rougher and readier formula. Now, if you're playing doubles, then the person on your side of the net is in a non-zero-sum relationship with you, because every point is either good for both of you -- positive, win-win -- or bad for both of you, it's lose-lose. So, kind of webs of non-zero-sumness are where you would expect compassion and the golden rule to kind of work their magic. So, I think that's good. This is not the same as compassion, but it's conducive to compassion.

327,"And that's what that moment with Patricia Schroeder I think shows: that if we are to bring about an end to the world's worst atrocities, we have to make it such. It sees itself, such as it is, the it, as something that will create the impression that there will be political cost, there will be a political price to be paid, for allowing genocide, for not having an heroic imagination, for not being an upstander but for being, in fact, a bystander. They have a 1-800-GENOCIDE number -- this is going to sound very kitsch, but for those of you who may not be, I mean, may be apolitical, but interested in doing something about genocide, you dial 1-800-GENOCIDE and you type in your zip code, and you don't even have to know who your congressperson is. And the students and the others who are part of this incredibly energized base are there to answer that, and there's always something to do.

I think there are a couple -- there are many reasons -- but a couple just to focus on briefly. So this movement, if it's to be durable and global, will have to cross borders, and you will have to see other citizens in democracies, not simply resting on the assumption that their government would do something in the face of genocide, but actually making it such. What do you do? If we think about dignity in our conduct as citizens and as individuals with relation to the people around us, and as a country, if we could inject a regard for dignity into our dealings with other countries, it would be something of a revolution. And the lesson, I think, of the anti-genocide movement that I mentioned, that is a partial success but by no means has it achieved what it has set out to do -- it'll be many decades, probably, before that happens -- but is that if we want to see change, we have to become the change.","john avlon: if we want to end genocide, we have to make it such. avlon: if we want to see change, we have to become the change. avlon: if we want to see change, we have to become the change.","Would you negotiate with someone you knew to be evil, to save lives?

328,"In about two minutes, it had reached the level of the railroad tracks and was coming over it. We don't think another wave is coming right away. In the world of blogs, there's going to be before the tsunami and after the tsunami, because one of the things that happened in the wake of the tsunami was that, although initially -- that is, in that first day -- there was actually a kind of dearth of live reporting, there was a dearth of live video and some people complained about this. What became very clear was that, within a few days, the outpouring of information was immense, and we got a complete and powerful picture of what had happened in a way that we never had been able to get before. And what you had was a group of essentially unorganized, unconnected writers, video bloggers, etc., who were able to come up with a collective portrait of a disaster that gave us a much better sense of what it was like to actually be there than the mainstream media could give us. You know, if you think about something like Google, which essentially is relying on the collective intelligence of the Web to seek out those sites that have the most valuable information -- we know that Google does an exceptionally good job of doing that, and it does that because, collectively, this disorganized thing we call the ""World Wide Web"" actually has a remarkable order, or a remarkable intelligence in it. But what the blogosphere offers is the possibility of getting at the kind of collective, distributive intelligence that is out there, and that we know is available to us if we can just figure out a way of accessing it. It is very easy to think that networks are necessarily good things -- that being linked from one place to another, that being tightly linked in a group, is a very good thing. So, one of the phenomena that's very clear in the blogosphere is that once a meme, once an idea gets going, it is very easy for people to just sort of pile on, because other people have, say, a link.

334,"The fact is, when we do our market research around the world, we see there's a nearly universal aspiration on the part of people to own an automobile -- 750 million people in the world today own a car. We really have to ask the question: Can the world sustain that number of automobiles? A lot of hydrogen is produced today in the world. What we've targeted for ourselves -- and we're making great progress toward this goal -- is to have a propulsion system based on hydrogen and fuel cells, designed and validated, that can go head-to-head with the internal combustion engine.

Yes, they do have larger body size, but many of them are smaller, but we're interested in the time it took them to achieve that.

That is to say, at that time it was believed that there was nothing up there except the branches of Redwood trees. There they are. And then it bursts into a forest of Redwoods. But as you go and you look closer at a tree, what you see is, you see increasing complexity. One of the things that is just -- I almost can't conceive it -- is the idea that the national news media hasn't picked this up at all, and this is the devastation of one of the most important ecosystems in North America. But we're different from trees, and they can also teach us something about ourselves in the differences that we have. (Applause) Chris Anderson: I think at a previous TED, I think it was Nathan Myhrvold who told me that it was thought that because these trees are like, 2,000 years and older, on many of them there are ecosystems where there are species that are not found anywhere on the Earth except on that one tree.

339,"And so for me, I know that when the Internet came around and I was doing computer programming and just, you know, just generally trying to run my own little company and figure out what to do with the Internet and with computers, I was just immediately struck by how the ultimate thing that you would really want to do with the Internet and with computers would be to use the Internet and connected computers to simulate a world to sort of recreate the laws of physics and the rules of how things went together -- the sort of -- the idea of atoms and how to make things, and do that inside a computer so that we could all get in there and make stuff. And in fact, it's going to be so different than what we see here on earth that anything is going to be possible. You know, to give you a size idea about scale, you know, comparing space to Second Life, most people don't realize, kind of -- and then this is just like the Internet in the early '90s. I'd say I kind of think about the world as being information. That's one way of organizing information, but there are two things about the way you access information in a virtual world that I think are the important ways that they're very different and much better than what we've been able to do to date with the Web. When you're on Amazon.com and you're looking for digital cameras or whatever, you're on there right now, when you're on the site, with like 5,000 other people, but you can't talk to them. And so I think, again, that it's likely that in the next decade or so these virtual worlds are going to be the most common way as human beings that we kind of use the electronics of the Internet, if you will, to be together, to consume information. You have to have that level of freedom, and so I'm often asked that, you know, is there a, kind of, utopian or, is there a utopian tendency to Second Life and things like it, that you would create a world that has a grand scheme to it? And what was so amazing right from the start was that the idea that we had put out in the zoning concept, basically, was instantly and thoroughly ignored, and like, two months into the whole thing, -- which is really a small amount of time, even in Second Life time -- I remember the users, the people who were then using Second Life, the residents came to me and said, we want to buy the disco -- because I had built it -- we want to buy that land and raze it and put houses on it. So, that's it.","in the next decade or so, virtual worlds are going to be the most common way to consume information. virtual worlds are going to be the most common way as human beings that we use the electronics of the Internet. the idea that we had put out in the zoning concept was instantly and thoroughly ignored.","Why build a virtual world?

350,"And that is a wonderful stepping away in perspective, to try to then think about the way our planet behaves, as a planet, and with the life that's on it. So, what about life on Mars? And so where there is water, there is a very high chance of our kind of life. How do you know it when you find it? But the real issue is that we are guided by our limited experience, and until we can think out of the box of our cranium and what we know, then we can't recognize what to look for, or how to plan for it. And every time they do that, they get a tiny little packet of energy. These organisms we now bring into the lab, and you can see some of them growing on Petri plates, and get them to reproduce the precise biominerals that we find on the walls of these caves. And the future is there for us to use these lava-tube caves on Mars. The question as to whether there is life on Mars that is related to life on Earth has now been very muddied, because we now know, from Mars meteorites that have made it to Earth, that there's material that can be exchanged between those two planets.

And the way he tells it, there was a famous Chinese diplomat that showed up, and he was told to make a dish that looked very popular and could, quote, ""pass"" as Chinese. There is Italian Chinese food, where they don't have fortune cookies, so they serve fried gelato. I went across the country, looking for these restaurants where these people had gotten their fortune cookies from. The trick was, they were able to remove the chicken from the bone in a cost-efficient manner, which is why it took so long for people to copy them -- 10 years, then within a couple months, it was such a hit, they introduced it across the entire McDonald's system in the country.","general Tso chicken is a lot like Colonel Sanders in that he's known for chicken. there is Italian Chinese food, where they don't have fortune cookies. within a couple months, it was such a hit, they introduced it across the entire McDonald's system.",Reporter Jennifer 8.

And, I mean -- this kind of stuff, you know, all this stuff came from that separation of this little sort of thing that we do -- now I, when I was a boy was born sort of with this idea that if you want to know something -- you know, maybe it's because my old man was gone a lot, and my mother didn't really know much science, but I thought if you want to know something about stuff, you do it -- you make an experiment, you know. (Laughter) You sort of -- now you say, well, let's see if I can get hold of some potassium chlorate and sugar, perchlorate and sugar, and heat it; it would be interesting to see what it is they don't want me to do, and what it is going to -- and how is it going to work.

I mean, it's all -- you've got to be very honest with what you're doing if it really is going to work. Now, people like things that have, like, names like that, that they can envision it, right?

And so you could see that as this disc rotates about this axis, it will create a disc of light that we can control. But what is new is that, when we rotate this disc about this axis, this disc of light actually becomes a sphere of light. And so we can control that with micro-controllers and create a fully volumetric, three-dimensional display with just 256 LEDs. Now this piece is currently in process -- due out in May -- but what we've done is we've put together a small demo, just to show the geometric translation of points into a sphere.

354,"Till a couple months later, I went back to the same airport -- same plane, I think -- and looked up, and it said C. (Laughter) It was only then that I realized it was simply a gate that I was coming into. You know, you get the message. That was it. I was, O.K. And I thought, you know, what were they thinking? And it was interesting to me -- my background is in sociology; I had no design training, and sometimes people say, well, that explains it -- but it was a very interesting experiment because there's no product that I had to sell; it was simply the image of Microsoft they were trying to improve. But anyway, this is one of the ads I was most pleased with, because they were all elaborately art-directed, and this one I thought actually felt like the girl was looking at the computer. And -- I gave a talk in New York a couple months after this, and afterwards somebody came up to me and they said that -- they actually emailed me -- and they said that they appreciated the talk, and when they got back to their car, they found a note on their car that made them think maybe New York was getting back to being New York again after this event -- it had been a few months. I'm not sure this is an improvement, or a good idea, because, like, if you don't spend quite enough time in front of your computer, you can now get a plate in the keyboard, so there's no more faking it -- that you don't really sit at your desk all day and eat and work anyway.

355,"Dad wasn't a real militaristic kind of guy; he just felt bad that he wasn't able to fight in World War II on account of his handicap, although they did let him get through the several-hour-long army physical exam before they got to the very last test, which was for vision. Same thing: he understood the shape of the future, even though it was something that would only be implemented by people much later. I think these are the four principles that go into this. Also, another sense which comics' vision represents, and that's time. So I wrote a book about this in '93, but as I was finishing the book, I had to do a little bit of typesetting, and I was tired of going to my local copy shop to do it, so I bought a computer. The problem was that if you go with this basic idea that space equals time in comics, what happens is that when you introduce sound and motion, which are temporal phenomena that can only be represented through time, they break with that continuity of presentation. Each of them has a single unbroken reading line, whether it's going zigzag across the walls or spiraling up a column or just straight left to right, or even going in a backwards zigzag across those 88 accordion-folded pages, the same thing is happening; that is, that the basic idea that as you move through space you move through time, is being carried out without any compromise, but there were compromises when print hit. This was back in the late '90s, and other people in my business thought I was pretty crazy, but a lot of people then went on and actually did it. But even though we're only experiencing it one piece at a time, that's just where the technology is right now. See what's going on here as we draw these stories on an infinite canvas is you're creating a more pure expression of what this medium is all about.","bob greene: comics' vision is that space equals time. he says sound and motion are temporal phenomena that can only be represented through time. greene: we're only experiencing it one piece at a time, but that's just where the technology is.","In this unmissable look at the magic of comics, Scott McCloud bends the presentation format into a cartoon-like experience, where colorful diversions whiz through childhood fascinations and imagined futures that our eyes can hear and touch."
356,"And I used three criteria: the first was, I thought I'd talk about real design within reach, design that's free, not design not quite within reach, as we're fondly known by our competition and competitors, but stuff that you can find on the streets, stuff that was free, stuff that was available to all people, and stuff that probably contains some other important messages. And I had a bit of a wake-up call in Amsterdam: I was there going into the design stores, and mixing with our crowd of designers, and I recognized that a whole lot of stuff pretty much looked the same, and the effect of globalization has had that in our community also. I was walking around on the streets of Amsterdam and I recognized, you know, the big story from Amsterdam isn't what's in the design stores, it's what's out on the streets, and maybe it's self-explanatory, but a city that hasn't been taken over by modernism, that's preserved its kind of architecture and character, and where the bicycle plays an important part of the way in which people get around and where pedestrian rights are protected. I then kind of thought about the other cities in Europe where I spend a lot of time looking for design, like Basel, where Vitra is located, or in northern Italy -- all cities where there are a whole lot of bicycles, and where pedestrian areas -- and I came to the conclusion that perhaps there was something about these important design centers that dealt with bicycles and foot traffic, and I'm sure the skeptic eye would say, no, the correlation there is that there are universities and schools where people can't afford cars, but it did seem that in many of these areas pedestrian traffic was protected. And I realized that, you know, Italy is a place where they can accept these different ideologies and deal with diversity and not have the problem, or they can choose to ignore them, but these -- you don't have warring factions, and I think that maybe the tolerance of the absurdity which has made Italy so innovative   and so tolerant. And as I look at it, I sort of say, you know, the publications that report on problems in the urban area also contribute to it, and it's just my call to say to all of us, public policy won't change this at all; private industry has to work to take things like this seriously. Now, this is not going to impress you guys who Photoshop, and can do stuff,  but this was an actual moment when I got off my bike, and I looked and I thought, it's as if all of my biker brethren had kind of gotten together and conspired to make a little statement. And I do think pattern has the capability of eradicating some of the most evil forces of society, such as bad form in restaurants, but quite seriously, it was a statement to me that one thing that you do, sort of, see is the aggressive nature of the industrial world has produced -- kind of, large masses of things, and when you -- in monoculture, and I think the preservation of diversity in culture is something that's important to us. The U.S. is actually becoming a bit of a leader in kind of enlightened urban planning and renewal, and I want to single out a place like Chicago, where I look at some guy like Mayor Daley as a bit of a design hero for being able to work through the political processes and all that to improve an area. And it's a welcoming area, I think, inclusive of diversity, reflective of diversity, and I think this marriage of both technology and art in the public sector is an area where the U.S. can really take a leadership role, and Chicago is one example.","cnn's john sutter says he had a bit of a wake-up call in Amsterdam. he says the big story from Amsterdam isn't what's in the design stores, it's what's out on the streets. sutter: public policy won't change this at all.","Rob Forbes, the founder of Design Within Reach, shows a gallery of snapshots that inform his way of seeing the world.

357,"So much has that happened that I've developed a fairly praticed response, which is: I point out that first of all, you have to understand that there is no such thing as an inauthentic experience. And now, with the experience economy, it's about rendering authenticity. And of course, if you are both true to yourself, and are what you say you are, then you're real real! All right, now, there is value for fake.

It is what it says it is: It's Universal Studio; it's in the city of Los Angeles; you're going to walk a lot. It's not what it says it is.

358,"A genome is really a description for  all of the DNA that is in a living organism. In fact, many, many diseases we have struggled with for a long time, like cancer, we haven't been able to cure because we just don't understand how it works at the genomic level. So, up to this point we tried to fix it by using what I call shit-against-the-wall pharmacology, which means, well, let's just throw chemicals at it, and maybe it's going to make it work. And if you think about the computer industry and how we've gone from big computers to little ones and how they get more powerful and faster all the time, the same thing is happening with gene sequencing now: we are on the cusp of being able to sequence human genomes for about 5,000 dollars in about an hour or a half-hour; you will see that happen in the next five years. You will give your genome to the pharmacist, and your drug will be made for you and it will work much better than the ones that were -- you won't have side effects. If you saw the genome for a mouse or for a human it would look no different than this, but what scientists are doing now is they're understanding what these do and what they mean. So, what can we do with genomes now that we can read them, now that we're starting to have the book of life? Now, you have the genome and you say to yourself, So, if I plug this synthetic genome -- if I pull the old one out and plug it in -- does it just boot up and live?

359,"Well, I'm really excited to talk a bit about my own upbringing in music and family and all of that, but I'm even more excited for you people to hear about Donnell's amazing family and maybe even a little bit about how we met, and all that sort of thing, but for those of you that may not be familiar with my upbringing, I'm from Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, eastern Canada, which is a very, very musical island, and its origins come from Scotland with the music and all the traditions, the dancing, the language, which unfortunately is dying out in Cape Breton. Well, cèilidh first of all is Gaelic for party, but kitchen party in Cape Breton is very common, and basically somebody drops into the house, and no matter what house you go to in Cape Breton, there's a fiddle there, guaranteed, and I'd say, well there's first of all more fiddlers per capita in Cape Breton than anywhere in the world, so ten chances to one, the fellow who walked in the door could play it, so you'd have someone come into the house, you'd invite them to play a tune, and lo and behold a little party would start up and somebody would dance, and somebody would sing, and all that sort of thing, so it was a wonderful, wonderful way to grow up, and that is where my beginnings in music come from: my surroundings, my family, just my bloodline in itself, and, oh, I've done lots of things with my music. I was nominated for a Grammy and I've won some awards and stuff like that, so that's awesome, but the best part was meeting my husband, and I've actually known Donnell for probably 12 years now, and I'm going to get into a little bit of, I guess, how music brought us together, but I'm going to introduce you right now to my new husband as of October 5, Donnell Leahy. Years ago, hundreds of men would go up for the winter to the camps in Northern Ontario and in Quebec, and they were all different cultures, and the Irish, the French, Scottish, German, they'd all meet, and of course at night, they'd play cards and step dance and play fiddles, and over the course of many years, the Ottawa Valley fiddling kind of evolved and the Ottawa Valley step dancing evolved, so that's, I kind of started out with that style and I quickly started doing my own thing, and then I met Natalie, and I was exposed to the great Cape Breton fiddling. Well, it's just so interesting that Donnell's upbringing was very similar to mine, and I actually saw Donnell play when I was about 12 years old, and he and his family came to Inverness, which is about 45 minutes from where I lived, and I was just blown away, like, it was just amazing, and you'll find out why pretty soon here, but I couldn't believe the fiddling and Mom was there with me, and she was saying — Donnell's mother came up on stage and danced with her children, and Mom was saying, ""That's Julie MacDonnell, I used to dance with her when we were kids. (Laughter) (Applause) DL: So anyway, we're running out of time, so I'll just get to it. I'm going to play a piece of music for you. I'll quickly play a short part of the air, and then I'm going to get into kind of a crazy tune that is very difficult to play when you're not warmed up, so, if I mess it up, pretend you like it anyway. Before Mom's family had a piano in Cape Breton, she learned to play the rhythms on a piece of board, and the fiddlers would all congregate to play on the cold winter's evenings and Mom would be banging on this board, so when they bought a piano, they bought it in Toronto and had it taken by train and brought in on a horse, a horse and sleigh to the house. (Applause) (Laughter) DL: Oh yeah, okay, in my family we had seven girls, four boys, we had two fiddles and one piano, and of course we were all fighting to play on the instruments, so dad and mom set a rule that you couldn't kick anyone off the instrument.","Donnell Leahy is from Cape Breton Island, a very musical island. he's known Donnell for probably 12 years, and he's now married. he says he's a great musician, but he's also a great songwriter.","Natalie MacMaster and her musical partner Donnell Leahy play several tunes from the Cape Breton tradition -- a sprightly, soulful style of folk fiddling.

360,"Well, Don Brownlee, my friend, and I finally got to the point where we got tired of turning on the TV and seeing the spaceships and seeing the aliens every night, and tried to write a counter-argument to it, and put out what does it really take for an Earth to be habitable, for a planet to be an Earth, to have a place where you could probably get not just life, but complexity, which requires a huge amount of evolution, and therefore constancy of conditions. It was, ""It burns! And I really do think we have to start thinking about what's a good planet and what isn't. Now, I throw this slide up because it indicates to me that, even if SETI does hear something, can we figure out what they said?

362,"They like to eat healthy and healthily, but when we think of something as a health food, we think of it as something we eat out of obligation, not out of passion and love for the flavor. We're going to try this at lunch, and I'll explain a bit more about it, but it's made not only with two types of pre-doughs -- this attempt, again, at bringing out flavor is to make a piece of dough the day before that is not leavened. And it's made -- it can be a sourdough starter, or what we call a ""biga"" or any other kind of pre-fermented dough with a little yeast in it, and that starts to develop flavor also. And we're hoping that, sort of, the enzyme piece of dough becomes the fuel pack for the leavened piece of dough, and when we put them together and add the final ingredients, we can create a bread that does evoke the full potential of flavor trapped in the grain. And somehow, this is transformed -- the yeast burps and sweats are later transformed -- and this is really getting to the heart of what makes bread so special is that it is a transformational food, and we're going to explore that in a minute.

And what's really important in this stuff is, as we cut, we also have to grow. And as you bring these trends together, and as you think of what it means to take people who are profoundly deaf, who can now begin to hear -- I mean, remember the evolution of hearing aids, right? (Laughter) I think what we're going to see is we're going to see a different species of hominid.

364,"And the second thing I learned was that I knew, with profound certainty, that this is exactly what I was going to do for the rest of my life. The limitation of diving with air is all those dots in your body, all the nitrogen and all the oxygen. But if we want to go deeper, of course, we need another gas supply, and helium is what we really need to go deep. We also have a second oxygen cylinder, solely as a backup; if there's a problem with our first oxygen supply, we can continue to breathe. I'm going to take you on a deep dive, and show you what it's like to do one. (Laughter) So we're down there -- this is at 400 feet. And if you're a biologist and know about sharks, and you want to assess, how much jeopardy am I really in here, there's one question that sort of jumps to the forefront of your mind immediately, which is -- (Video) Diver 1: What kind of sharks? When we first found it, we weren't even sure what family it belonged to, so we just called it the Dr. Seuss fish, since it looked like something from one of those books. What's extraordinary is not just the number of species we're finding -- though as you can see, that's pretty amazing; this is only half of what we've found -- what's extraordinary is how quickly we find them. The reason I show this -- not to put a downer on everything -- but I just want to use it to key off my philosophy of life in general, which is that we all have two goals.","diving with air is a limitation, but if we want to go deeper, we need another gas supply. we also have a second oxygen cylinder, solely as a backup. diving with helium is the best way to go deep, says dr. seuss.","In this illuminating talk, Richard Pyle shows us thriving life on the cliffs of coral reefs and groundbreaking diving technologies he has pioneered to explore it.

365,"And David and I discovered that we had a question in common, that we really wanted the answer to, and that was, ""Why hasn't anybody built any computer games for little girls?"" So David and I decided to go find out, through the best research we could muster, what it would take to get a little girl to put her hands on a computer, to achieve the level of comfort and ease with the technology that little boys have because they play video games. They taught me how to look and see, and they did not do the incredibly stupid thing of saying to a child, ""Of all these things we already make you, which do you like best?"" After we had done that with a pretty large team of people and discovered what we thought the salient issues were with girls and boys and playing -- because, after all, that's really what this is about -- we moved to the second phase of our work, where we interviewed adult experts in academia, some of the people who'd produced the literature that we found relevant. We launched two titles in October -- ""Rockett's New School"" -- the first of a series of products -- is about a character called Rockett beginning her first day of school in eighth grade at a brand new place, with a blank slate, which allows girls to play with the question of, ""What will I be like when I'm older?"" I want to talk about the other, because the politics of this enterprise, in a way, have been the most fascinating part of it, for me. These are pictures the girls themselves never saw, but they gave to us This is the stuff those reviewers don't know about and aren't listening to and this is the kind of research I recommend to those who want to do humanistic work.

366,"I'm going to play it for you in a couple minutes,   but I want to make an analogy before I do  to this. Now, think about where the world would be today   if we had the light bulb, but you couldn't focus light; if when you turned one on it just went wherever it wanted to. Now, after almost 80 years of having sound, I thought it was about time that we figure out a way to put sound where you want to. (Applause) Because I have some limited time, I'll cut it off for a second, and tell you about how it works and what it's good for. And, you know, if the sound isn't there, the sale typically isn't made. But what's great about it, from the tests that have been done, is, if you don't want to hear it, you take about one step to the side and you don't hear it. And the sound that you're hearing, unlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is made on the face, is made out in front of it, in the air. So, again, this idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want to is really starting to catch on. We put it on a turret with a camera, so that when they shoot at you, you're over there, and it's there. I usually figure out what my talk is when I get up in front of a group.","bob greene: after 80 years of having sound, it's about time that we figure out a way to put sound where you want to. he says we put it on a turret with a camera so that when they shoot at you, it's there. greene: if you don't want to hear it, you take about one step to the side and you don't hear it.","Woody Norris shows off two of his inventions that use sound in new ways, including the Long Range Acoustic Device, or LRAD.

370,"I want to share with you my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us, and to consider why it matters that in 50 years, we've lost -- actually, we've taken, we've eaten -- more than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea; why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared; why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the Pacific should concern not only the creatures that are dying, but it really should concern you. We need to learn everything we can about it and do everything we can to take care of it. Yet we have this idea, we humans, that the Earth -- all of it: the oceans, the skies -- are so vast and so resilient it doesn't matter what we do to it. Since then, I've had the great pleasure of working with the Googlers, with DOER Marine, with National Geographic, with dozens of the best institutions and scientists around the world, ones that we could enlist, to put the ocean in Google Earth. All of these parts are part of our life support system. This is the consequence of not knowing that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea. There are still some blue whales. Imagine what that means to our life support system. The good news is that there are now more than 4,000 places in the sea, around the world, that have some kind of protection. With scientists around the world, I've been looking at the 99 percent of the ocean that is open to fishing -- and mining, and drilling, and dumping, and whatever -- to search out hope spots, and try to find ways to give them and us a secure future.","in 50 years, we've lost -- actually, we've taken, we've eaten -- more than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea. a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the Pacific should concern you, he says. he says we humans think the oceans are so vast and so resilient it doesn't matter what we do to them. he says there are now more than 4,000 places in the sea that have some kind of protection.",Legendary ocean researcher Sylvia Earle shares astonishing images of the ocean -- and shocking stats about its rapid decline -- as she makes her TED Prize wish: that we will join her in protecting the vital blue heart of the planet.

So I decided that I had to come up with a solution for her but also a solution that will benefit the people that are trying to exploit those forests, to get their hands on the last timber and that are causing, in that way, the loss of habitat and all those victims. So I created the place Samboja Lestari, and the idea was, if I can do this on the worst possible place that I can think of where there is really nothing left, no one will have an excuse to say, ""Yeah, but ..."" No. Still, in this place, in this grassland where you can see our very first office there on that hill, four years later, there is this one green blop on the Earth's surface ... (Applause) And there are all these animals, and all these people happy, and there's this economic value. If you can drop this recipe on the map on a sandy soil, on a clay soil, on a steep slope, on flat soil, you put those different recipes; if you combine them, out of that comes a business plan, comes a work plan, and you can optimize it for the amount of labor you have available or for the amount of fertilizer you have, and you can do it. So you have to do it with the local people. It's not that simple, and you have to work with the people. That you can go from this zero situation, by planting the vegetables and the trees, or directly, the trees in the lines in that grass there, putting up the buffer zone, producing your compost, and then making sure that at every stage of that up growing forest there are crops that can be used. In summary, if you look at it, in year one the people can sell their land to get income, but they get jobs back in the construction and the reforestation, the working with the orangutans, and they can use the waste wood to make handicraft.

378,"And the reason that that was the model    of beauty and of nature was because the decimal point had not been invented yet --    it wasn't the 16th century -- and everybody had to dimension a building    in terms of fractions, so a room would be dimensioned    as one-fourth of a facade; the structural dais of that might be dimensioned as 10 units, and you would get down to the small elements    by fractional subdivision:    finer and finer and finer. So, what's going on today    is that there's a model of natural form which is calculus-based    and which is using digital tools, and that has a lot of implications    to the way we think about beauty and form,    and it has a lot of implications in the way we think about nature. But what was important is,    the Gothic moment in architecture was the first time    that force and motion was thought of in terms of form. In all these examples,   there's one ideal form,   because these are thought in terms of structure. To just talk for a minute about the    digital mediums that we're using now    and how they integrate calculus: the fact that they're calculus-based    means that we don't have to think about dimension   in terms of ideal units    or discreet elements. That's because we're all using calculus tools    for manufacturing and for design. It also is much more dynamic,    so that you can see that the same form opens and closes    in a very dynamic way as you move across it,    because it has this quality of vector in motion   built into it. I think that's one of the main changes,    also, in architecture:    that we're starting to look now not for some ideal form, like a Latin cross for a church,    but actually all the traits of a church:   so, light that comes from behind from an invisible source,   directionality that focuses you towards an altar. So, for me, what was important is that    this coffee set -- which is just a coffee pot, a teapot,    and those are the pots sitting on a tray --    that they would have a coherence --   so, they would be Greg Lynn Alessi coffee pots --    but that everyone who bought one    would have a one-of-a-kind object that was unique in some way.

Because if you're in this world, where computers are controlling what you're doing, it's going to be very critical that something can't fail on you. After all, if you can fly like that, why are you going to drive around on a highway? And I know the pilots in the audience aren't going to like that --  and I've had a lot of bad feedback from people who want to be up there, flying around and experiencing that. (Laughter) I'd like to show you an animation in this next one, which is one element of the Skycar's use, but it's one that demonstrates how it could be used.","the skycar is a vehicle that could do for you, or me, what the hummingbird does. bob greene: it's still one of those wonderful experiences that reward you for all that time. greene: if we can get rid of that, highways will now be useful to you. greene: if we can get rid of that, highways will be useful to you.",Paul Moller talks about the future of personal air travel -- the marriage of autos and flight that will give us true freedom to travel off-road.

380,"But it would be worse, except for that I happen to remember that over 20 years ago, when I was a teenager, when I first started telling people that I wanted to be a writer, I was met with this same sort of fear-based reaction. It just didn't come up like that, you know? I have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between me, as I am writing, and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be, from now on. They believed that a genius was this, sort of magical divine entity, who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist's studio, kind of like Dobby the house elf, and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work and would shape the outcome of that work. You know, I think that allowing somebody, one mere person to believe that he or she is like, the vessel, you know, like the font and the essence and the source of all divine, creative, unknowable, eternal mystery is just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile, human psyche. (Laughter) So when I heard that I was like -- that's uncanny, that's exactly what my creative process is like. (Laughter) That's not at all what my creative process is -- I'm not the pipeline! It saved me when I was in the middle of writing ""Eat, Pray, Love,"" and I fell into one of those sort of pits of despair that we all fall into when we're working on something and it's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster, the worst book ever written. But if you don't do that, you know what, the hell with it. And I know you know what I'm talking about, because I know you've all seen, at some point in your life, a performance like this.","lz granderson: when i first started telling people that i wanted to be a writer, i was met with a fear-based reaction. granderson: allowing someone to believe that he or she is a genius is just a smidge too much responsibility. he says it saved me when i was in the middle of writing ""Eat, Pray, Love"" granderson: if you don't do that, you know what, the hell with it.","Elizabeth Gilbert muses on the impossible things we expect from artists and geniuses -- and shares the radical idea that, instead of the rare person ""being"" a genius, all of us ""have"" a genius.

381,"These janitors have the moral will to do right by other people. When you ask the janitors who behaved like the ones I described how hard it is to learn to do their job, they tell you that it takes lots of experience. If you have one reason for doing something and I give you a second reason for doing the same thing, it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one and you're more likely to do it. but 'Is it right?'""

382,"I'm hired to be solemn, but I find more and more that I'm solemn when I don't have to be. And to do stuff that wasn't made out of Helvetica was actually kind of hard because you had to find it. And first I was praised for it, then criticized for it, but the fact of the matter was, I had become solemn. I didn't do what I think was a piece of serious work again for about 14 years. I spent most of the '80s being quite solemn, turning out these sorts of designs that I was expected to do because that's who I was, and I was living in this cycle of going from serious to solemn to hackneyed to dead, and getting rediscovered all over again. And I think that you know when you're going to be given this position, and it's rare, but when you get it and you have this opportunity, it's the moment of serious play. So, I changed it so that every season was different, and I continued to do these posters, but they never had the seriousness of the first identity because they were too individual, and they didn't have that heft of everything being the same thing. I didn't know how to read an architectural plan, I didn't know what they were talking about, and I really couldn't handle the fact that a job -- a single job -- could go on for four years because I was used to immediacy in graphic design, and that kind of attention to detail was really bad for somebody like me, with ADD.

383,"We want to offer people an idea of what they can do about it. The truth is, we can build a better world, and we can do so right now. Most importantly, we have the motive: we have a world that needs fixing, and nobody's going to do it for us. (Laughter) For many of us, cell phones have really become almost an extension of ourselves, and we're really now beginning to see the social changes that mobile phones can bring about. And I'm just incredibly happy to see the news that Witness is going to be opening up a Web portal to enable users of digital cameras and camera phones to send in their recordings over the Internet, rather than just hand-carrying the videotape. It would highlight the changes that are underway, but would more importantly give voice to the people who are willing to work to see a new world, a better world, come about. It would be, in essence, an ""Earth Witness"" project. But the Earth Witness project wouldn't need to be limited to problems.

384,"I've heard what I consider an extraordinary thing that I've only heard a little bit in the two previous TEDs, and what that is is an interweaving and an interlarding, an intermixing, of a sense of social responsibility in so many of the talks -- global responsibility, in fact, appealing to enlightened self-interest, but it goes far beyond enlightened self-interest. One of the most impressive things about what some, perhaps 10, of the speakers have been talking about is the realization, as you listen to them carefully, that they're not saying: Well, this is what we should do; this is what I would like you to do. And the only explanation I can have for some of what you've been hearing in the last four days is that it arises, in fact, out of a form of love. So, Sarah and I -- my wife -- walked over to the public library, which is four blocks away, on Pacific Street, and we got the OED, and we looked in there, and there are 14 definitions of hope, none of which really hits you between the eyes as being the appropriate one. And I find that very interesting and very provocative, because what you've been hearing in the last couple of days is the sense of going in different directions: directions that are specific and unique to problems. He was talking to a very large man, but I didn't care. Do you know what the world will be saved by? And I think that it's going to be, in time, the elements of the human spirit that we've been hearing about bit by bit by bit from so many of the speakers in the last few days. What is it that we have every right to ask of ourselves, out of our shared humanity and out of the human spirit? Now, if we're talking about medicine, and we're talking about healing, I'd like to quote someone who hasn't been quoted.","john avlon: i've heard an interweaving and an interlarding of a sense of social responsibility. avlon: what you've been hearing in the last four days is the sense of going in different directions. he says we have every right to ask ourselves out of our shared humanity and out of the human spirit. avlon: if we're talking about medicine, we're talking about healing.","Sherwin Nuland, a surgeon and a writer, meditates on the idea of hope -- the desire to become our better selves and make a better world.

385,"Right when I was 15 was when I first got interested in solar energy. What if we collect the sun with a large reflector -- like I had been thinking about in high school, but maybe with modern technology we could make it cheaper -- concentrate it to a small converter, and then the conversion device wouldn't have to be as expensive, because it's much smaller, rather than solar cells, which have to cover the entire surface that you want to gather sun from. So we tried to look at all the different heat engines that have been used in history to convert sunlight or heat to electricity, And one of the great ones of all time, James Watt's steam engine of 1788 was a major breakthrough. So we tried to look at the Stirling engine in a new way, because it was practical -- weight no longer mattered for our application. So this is the engine. So you have the engine. This is what the first prototype of our system looked like with the petals and the engine in the center. But you can use it to optionally heat hot water and that brings the efficiency up even higher because some of the heat that you'd normally be rejecting, you can now use as useful energy, whether it's for a pool or hot water. So you don't have to just have a feel-good attitude about energy to want to have one of these. And it would be great if we could make our energy usage renewable, where as we're using the energy, we're creating it at the same pace, and I really hope we can get there.",solar energy is a renewable energy source that can be used to heat hot water. the engine can be used to convert sunlight or heat to electricity. the engine can also be used to heat a pool or hot water.,"Bill Gross, the founder of Idealab, talks about his life as an inventor, starting with his high-school company selling solar energy plans and kits.

So we decided to cast a series of little people that would play the different bodies of Benjamin at the different increments of his life and that we would in fact create a computer-generated version of Brad's head, aged to appear as Benjamin, and attach that to the body of the real actor. And it's not a special effects film; it has to be a man. (Laughter) So we had a big problem: we didn't know how we were going to do this.

389,"So, as a computer scientist inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects -- along with my adviser Pattie, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi -- I started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer, instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip moving around a flat desktop, what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically, arranging it the way we wanted? And as these tools become more physical, more aware of their motion, aware of each other, and aware of the nuance of how we move them, we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles. This Siftable is configured to show video, and if I tilt it in one direction, it'll roll the video this way; if I tilt it the other way it rolls it backwards. So here I'm -- (Applause) This is a Fibonacci sequence that I'm making with a simple equation program. (Applause) So these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab, and I managed to get them to try it out, and shoot a video. And, one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people many instructions. And you can inject these sounds into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want. You attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it. Video: (Music) DM: And now I'll attach the filter to the bass for some more expression.

In fact, I'll just go into one area -- if you're looking at Alzheimer's, for example, drug discovery -- there is a whole lot of linked data which is just coming out because scientists in that field realize this is a great way of getting out of those silos, because they had their genomics data in one database in one building, and they had their protein data in another.

397,"And I thought to myself, wouldn't it be great if I had my own dodo skeleton? Russian nuclear launch key: The one on the top is the picture of the one I found on eBay; the one on the bottom is the one I made for myself, because I couldn't afford the one on eBay. But in this case, it's not about the author, it's not about the book or the movie or the story, it's about the object in and of itself. And then there is this fourth level, which is a whole new object in the world: the prop made for the movie, the representative of the thing, becomes, in its own right, a whole other thing, a whole new object of desire. I'd bought a replica, a really crappy replica, of the Maltese Falcon on eBay, and had downloaded enough pictures to actually have some reasonable reference. It was made out of resin, which wasn't a common material for movie props about the time the movie was made. It's funny to me that it took a while to authenticate it, because I can see it compared to this thing, and I can tell you -- it's real, it's the real thing, it's made from the exact same mold that this one is. But again, I am not a sculptor, and so I don't know a lot of the tricks, like, I don't know how my friend Mike gets beautiful, shiny surfaces with his Sculpey; I certainly wasn't able to get it. Now, the great thing about getting it to this point was that because in the movie, when they finally bring out the bird at the end, and they place it on the table, they actually spin it. And I can state with authority at this point in time, when I'd finished it, of all of the replicas out there -- and there is a few -- this is by far the most accurate representation of the original Maltese Falcon than anyone has sculpted.","a replica of the maltese Falcon was made out of resin, which wasn't a common material for movie props. it took a while to authenticate it, and it's the exact same mold that this one is. skeleton is the most accurate representation of the original maltese Falcon than anyone has sculpted.","Adam Savage talks about his fascination with the dodo bird, and how it led him on a strange and surprising double quest.

399,"With the help of IIT, TERI, and learnings from NASA, we discovered that there are three basic green plants, common green plants, with which we can grow all the fresh air we need indoors to keep us healthy. Areca palm is a plant which removes CO2 and converts it into oxygen. We need four shoulder-high plants per person, and in terms of plant care, we need to wipe the leaves every day in Delhi, and perhaps once a week in cleaner-air cities. The third plant is money plant, and this is again a very common plant; preferably grows in hydroponics. With these three plants, you can grow all the fresh air you need. In fact, you could be in a bottle with a cap on top, and you would not die at all, and you would not need any fresh air. We have tried these plants at our own building in Delhi, which is a 50,000-square-feet, 20-year-old building. And the study showed that, compared to other buildings, there is a reduced incidence of eye irritation by 52 percent, respiratory systems by 34 percent, headaches by 24 percent, lung impairment by 12 percent and asthma by nine percent. It is also important for the environment, because the world's energy requirements are expected to grow by 30 percent in the next decade. 40 percent of the world's energy is taken up by buildings currently, and 60 percent of the world's population will be living in buildings in cities with a population of over one million in the next 15 years.",the world's energy requirements are expected to grow by 30 percent in the next decade. 40 percent of the world's energy is taken up by buildings currently. 60 percent of the world's population will be living in buildings in cities with a population of over one million.,"Researcher Kamal Meattle shows how an arrangement of three common houseplants, used in specific spots in a home or office building, can result in measurably cleaner indoor air."

And a fabulous man called Miles Loyd who lives on the outskirts of San Francisco, wrote this seminal paper that was completely ignored in the Journal of Energy about how to use basically an airplane on a piece of string to generate enormous amounts of electricity. And they can now span up to three hundred feet at the hub height, but they can't really go a lot higher, and more height is where the more wind is, and more power -- as much as twice as much. And Al Gore has spoken to why we need to hit one of these targets, and in reality what that means is in the next 30 to 40 years, we have to make 10 trillion watts or more of new clean energy somehow. And here we're actually generating about 10 kilowatts -- so, enough to power probably five United States households -- with a kite not much larger than this piano. So this is the equivalent for a kite flier of peeing in the snow -- that's tracing your name in the sky. And this is where we're actually going.

405,"In those days, those days which exist for me only as the most elusive memory now, when often the first sound you'd hear in the morning would be a storm of birdsong, then the soft clop of the hooves of the horse hauling a milk wagon down your block, and the last sound at night as likely as not would be your father pulling up in his car, having worked late again, always late, and going heavily down to the cellar, to the furnace, to shake out the ashes and damp the draft before he came upstairs to fall into bed -- in those long-ago days, women, my mother, my friends' mothers, our neighbors, all the women I knew -- wore, often much of the day, what were called housedresses, cheap, printed, pulpy, seemingly purposefully shapeless light cotton shifts that you wore over your nightgown and, when you had to go look for a child, hang wash on the line, or run down to the grocery store on the corner, under a coat, the twisted hem of the nightgown always lank and yellowed, dangling beneath. More than the curlers some of the women seemed constantly to have in their hair in preparation for some great event -- a ball, one would think -- that never came to pass; more than the way most women's faces not only were never made up during the day, but seemed scraped, bleached, and, with their plucked eyebrows, scarily masklike; more than all that it was those dresses that made women so unknowable and forbidding, adepts of enigmas to which men could have no access, and boys no conception. In those days, one hid much else as well: grown men didn't embrace one another, unless someone had died, and not always then; you shook hands or, at a ball game, thumped your friend's back and exchanged blows meant to be codes for affection; once out of childhood you'd never again know the shock of your father's whiskers on your cheek, not until mores at last had evolved, and you could hug another man, then hold on for a moment, then even kiss (your fathers bristles white and stiff now).

No, more than impulse or fancy, the girl knows what she's doing, the girl means something, the girl means to mean, because it occurs to her in that instant, that beautiful or not, bright yes or no, she's not who she is, she's not the person she is, and the reason, she suddenly knows, is that there's been so much premeditation where she is, so much plotting and planning, there's hardly a person where she is, or if there is, it's not her, or not wholly her, it's a self inhabited, lived in by her, and seemingly even as she thinks it she knows what's been missing: grace, not premeditation but grace, a kind of being in the world spontaneously, with grace.

408,"So looking at their three main markets for their product which were basically transportation design, interiors and furniture, we came up with the solution of taking an old Airstream trailer and gutting it, and trying to portray laminate, and a trailer, in kind of a fresh, new contemporary look. That seemed really like a crisis to me, that they had never been able to develop a vocabulary about escape, and about travel, and modernity in this trailer that was consistent with the shell. We really needed to do some archeology in the trailer itself to figure out what's authentic in an Airstream trailer, and what feels like it has true purpose and utility. The biggest difficulty on one of these trailers is that when you're designing there's actually no logical place to stop and start materials because of the continuous form of the trailer. What I had to devise was a way of fooling the eye into believing that all these panels are curved with the shell. What I came up with was a series of second skins that basically float over the aluminum shell. And what I was trying to do there was direct your eye in the space, so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way, and that the casework wouldn't break up the space. Trailer number two, you have a blank slate, you can to anything you want. They came to me and said, ""Well, what can we do to freshen this thing up? So the problem became -- and they set this dilemma to me -- that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology, and there's no money for tooling or molding.","an old Airstream trailer was gutted to give it a fresh, new contemporary look. a series of second skins float over the aluminum shell, fooling the eye into thinking it's curved with the shell. the interior is done using only our existing technology, and there's no money for tooling or molding.","In this low-key, image-packed talk from 2002, designer Christopher C.

409,"What we're going to do is actually just flash a series of photos behind me that show you the reality of robots used in war right now or already at the prototype stage. We now have 5,300. One of the people that I recently met with was an Air Force three-star general, and he said basically, where we're headed very soon is tens of thousands of robots operating in our conflicts, and these numbers matter, because we're not just talking about tens of thousands of today's robots, but tens of thousands of these prototypes and tomorrow's robots, because of course, one of the things that's operating in technology is Moore's Law, that you can pack in more and more computing power into those robots, and so flash forward around 25 years, if Moore's Law holds true, those robots will be close to a billion times more powerful in their computing than today. I've spent the last several years going around meeting with all the players in this field, from the robot scientists to the science fiction authors who inspired them to the 19-year-old drone pilots who are fighting from Nevada, to the four-star generals who command them, to even the Iraqi insurgents who they are targeting and what they think about our systems, and what I found interesting is not just their stories, but how their experiences point to these ripple effects that are going outwards in our society, in our law and our ethics, etc. So the first is that the future of war, even a robotics one, is not going to be purely an American one. And now we have the fact that we're converting more and more of our American soldiers that we would send into harm's way into machines, and so we may take those already lowering bars to war and drop them to the ground.

And that really struck me about my father, in the sense that he had such belief that somehow, doing these things giving in the way that he gave, that something good would come out of it, even in the middle of a war, there was a war with Pakistan at one point, and the construction stopped totally and he kept working, because he felt, ""Well when the war is done they'll need this building.""

411,"What I'm going to try to do is explain to you quickly how to predict, and illustrate it with some predictions about what Iran is going to do in the next couple of years. In order to look out for what's best for them or what they think is best for them, people have values -- they identify what they want, and what they don't want. Now in order to work out what people are going to do to pursue their interests, we have to think about who has influence in the world. If we're looking at Iran, the president of the United States we would like to think, may have some influence -- certainly the president in Iran has some influence -- but we make a mistake if we just pay attention to the person at the top of the power ladder because that person doesn't know much about Iran, or about energy policy, or about health care, or about any particular policy. There are lots of people shaping decisions and so if we want to predict correctly we have to pay attention to everybody who is trying to shape the outcome, not just the people at the pinnacle of the decision-making pyramid. We need to know what they say they want, not what they want in their heart of hearts, not what they think they can get, but what they say they want, because that is a strategically chosen position, and we can work backwards from that to draw inferences about important features of their decision-making. So with just that little bit of input we can work out what the choices are that people have, what the chances are that they're willing to take, what they're after, what they value, what they want, and what they believe about other people. How they got to where they are may be important in shaping the input information, but once we know where they are we're worried about where they're going to be headed in the future. If they don't know, who are the people trying to influence the decision, how much clout do they have, how much they care about this issue, and what do they say they want, are they experts? BBM: Well, people of Iran, this is what many of you are going to evolve to want, and we could get there a lot sooner, and you would suffer a lot less trouble from economic sanctions, and we would suffer a lot less fear of the use of military force on our end, and the world would be a better place.","john avlon: people have values, they identify what they want, and what they don't want. avlon: we make a mistake if we pay attention to the person at the top of the power ladder. avlon: we need to know what they say they want, not what they think they can get.","Bruce Bueno de Mesquita uses mathematical analysis to predict (very often correctly) such messy human events as war, political power shifts, Intifada ...

They all have a species-specific system, they have a molecule that says ""me.""

The thought that came to mind is that it needs to be as good as any car that you would have today. How do you do it within the economics that we have today? If you park your car and didn't plug in the heater, when you come back you don't have a car. First he let me go to the prime minister of the country, who told me, if you can find the money you need for this network, 200 million dollars, and if you can find a car company that will build that car in mass volume, in two million cars -- that's what we needed in Israel -- I'll give you country to invest the 200 million into. As we stared scaling it up we looked at what is the problem to come up to the U.S.? By 2015 we would have had at least 250 million new cars even at the pace we're going at right now. The business model in which the money that is actually coming in, to drive the car -- the minutes, the miles if you want, that you are all familiar with -- subsidize the price of the car, just like cellphones. And those are not 20 percent by 2020.

And yet, I don't really think it is because when it comes down to it, it's this larger trajectory that is really what is going to remain -- what people in the future are going to remember about this period. So it's not surprising that some people would wonder whether maybe 30 or 40 years from now, we'll look back at this instant in time, and all of the sort of talk about the Human Genome Project, and what all this is going to mean to us -- well, it will really mean precious little. Because when we talk about our genetics and our biology, and modifying and altering and adjusting these things, we're talking about changing ourselves. And look around you and know that what we really care about is that little bit of difference. And if you don't, who are you going to be? But when something is feasible in thousands of laboratories all over the world, which is going to be the case with these technologies, when there are large numbers of people who see them as beneficial, which is already the case, and when they're almost impossible to police, it's not a question of if this is going to happen, it's when and where and how it's going to happen. In the midst of all this amazing technology, and all these things that are occurring, it's really interesting because there is sort of a counter-revolution that is going on: a resurgence of interest in remedies from the past, in nutraceuticals, in all of these sorts of things that some people, in the pharmaceutical industry particularly, like to brand as non-science.

419,"There are nine, sort of, rules that I discovered after 35 years of rock climbing. The most friction you have is when you first put your hand or your foot on the rock. Don't do it. The interesting thing about this climb is it's not that hard. Beginning guys, it's like, they thrash, they thrash, they get 15 feet up -- and they can do about 15 pull-ups right -- And then they just flame out. Women are much more in balance because they don't have that idea that they're going to be able to do 100 pull-ups. They think about how to get the weight over their feet because it's sort of natural -- they carry you all day long. And of course there is rule number nine. I came up with rule number nine after I actually didn't plan for a fall, and went about 40 feet and cracked a rib. Once you get to that point where you know it's going to happen, you need to start thinking about how you're going to let go because that is the critical piece of not getting hurt -- how you're going to fall onto the rope, or if you're climbing without a rope, fall to a place where you can actually control the fall.","the most friction you have is when you first put your hand or your foot on the rock. rule number nine: don't fall onto the rope, or if you're climbing without a rope, fall to a place where you can control the fall.","In this talk from TED University 2009, veteran rock climber Matthew Childs shares nine pointers for rock climbing.

It's also a project that in a very beautiful way, the development of this has actually paralleled the evolution of life on earth, which is a particularly lovely thing to be saying right here in February 2009 -- which, as one of our previous speakers told us, is the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin. And the people in Chicago made a reef of their own. And the only way that mathematicians know how to model this structure is with crochet. But what she was doing was actually making a model of a mathematical structure, that many mathematicians had thought it was actually impossible to model.

421,"The product was that airplane. So I had to give up the approach of drawing the fantasy shapes and convert it to technical drawings -- the shape of the wing, the shape of the fuselage and so on -- and build an airplane over these drawings that I knew followed some of the principles of flying. And it had, once it was in the air, some of this romance that I was in love with. And the loose ideas had something to do with what I knew happened with people in the office, at the work place -- people who worked, and used task seating, a great many of them sitting in front of a computer all day long. So I took the approach that the chair should do as much for them as humanly possible or as mechanistically possible so that they didn't have to fuss with it. So that if you sit down on my chair, whether you're five feet tall or six foot six, it always deals with your weight and transfers the amount of force required to recline in a way that you don't have to look for something to adjust. (Laughter) So he said, ""Well I'll come over and look at it."" And the more you can recline, in a way, the better it is. The more the angle between here and here opens up -- and nowadays, with a screen in front of you, you don't want to have your eye drop too far in the recline, so we keep it at more or less the same level -- but you transfer weight off your tailbones. But to do that, if you have any amount of recline, it gets to the point where you need a headrest because nearly always, automatically hold your head in a vertical position, see?","the more you can recline, in a way, the better it is. the more the angle between here and here opens up, the better it is. the more you can recline, in a way, the better it is.",Design legend Niels Diffrient talks about his life in industrial design (and the reason he became a designer instead of a jet pilot).

422,"But there is also this part of the country, kind of in the middle region here. And we think people like this probably don't want to vote for people who look like this and are named Barack Obama. Actually we didn't ask them, but when they conducted exit polls in every state, in 37 states, out of the 50, they asked a question, that was pretty direct, about race. So you see big differences in different parts of the country on this question. You kind of see the relationship between the redder states of where more people responded and said, ""Yes, Barack Obama's race was a problem for me."" And so we can look at a bunch of different variables. And there are a couple of these that have strong predictive relationships, one of which is education, where you see the states with the fewest years of schooling per adult are in red, and you see this part of the country, the kind of Appalachians region, is less educated. So it's the combination of these two things: it's education and the type of neighbors that you have, which we'll talk about more in a moment. So what we're going to do now is take the white people in the survey and split them between those who have black neighbors -- or, really, some neighbor of another race -- and people who have only white neighbors. And even some questions about race -- for example affirmative action, which is kind of a political question, a policy question about race, if you will -- not much difference here.","in 37 states, out of the 50, they asked a question about race. john avlon: you see big differences in different parts of the country on this question. he says education and type of neighbors have strong predictive relationships. avlon: we'll talk about more in a moment.","Nate Silver has data that answers big questions about race in politics.

We're seeing this in events like Mumbai recently, where it's so much easier to report now than it is to consume it. There is so much information; what do you do? So what we find is that there is this great deal of wasted crisis information because there is just too much information for us to actually do anything with right now. How do we deal with that information that is coming in?

And don't despise the white bread because it really, I think, symbolizes the fact that bread and food have become plentiful and affordable to all. In the U.S. only one percent of the people are actually farmers. What we need to do is to go back to understanding what our food is about. And this is where I have to query all of you. What I want us to do is to keep up the science and even get more science in there but go to a kind of regional scale -- not just in terms of the scale of the fields, but in terms of the entire food network.

In the last two to three years, we have reached a steady state of HIV epidemic in the world. So, when we look at the pattern, one thing comes out very clearly: you see the blue bubbles and people say HIV is very high in Africa. (Laughter) And so it is in Africa -- it's a lot of difference. See the difference within one African country -- it goes from very low level to very high level, and most of the provinces in Kenya is quite modest.

437,"The third set of ideas are what I call as ""ideas that we argue about"" -- those are ideas where we have a fight, an ideological battle about how to do things. Because when you are a developing country in the world where you can see the problems that other countries are having, you can actually anticipate what that did and do things very differently. India is going to have a lot of young people with a demographic dividend for the next 30 years. What is unique about this demographic dividend is that India will be the only country in the world to have this demographic dividend. I believe these six factors -- the rise of the notion of population as human capital, the rise of Indian entrepreneurs, the rise of English as a language of aspiration, technology as something empowering, globalization as a positive factor, and the deepening of democracy -- has contributed to why India is today growing at rates it has never seen before. Therefore we need to create a new set of labor laws, which are not as onerous as they are today. At the same time give a policy for a lot more people to be in the formal sector, and create the jobs for the millions of people that we need to create jobs for. The first thing is, we're very fortunate that technology is at a point where it is much more advanced than when other countries had the development. And it is important to prove that growth and democracy are not incompatible, that you can have a democracy, that you can have an open society, and you can have growth. When India was growing at about three, 3.5 percent and the population was growing at two percent, its per capita income was doubling every 45 years.",india will be the only country in the world to have this demographic dividend for the next 30 years. india is growing at rates it has never seen before. we need to create a new set of labor laws that are not as onerous as they are today.,"Nandan Nilekani, the visionary co-founder of outsourcing pioneer Infosys, explains four brands of ideas that will determine whether India can continue its recent breakneck progress."

And I then challenged the people of Interface, my company, to lead our company and the entire industrial world to sustainability, which we defined as eventually operating our petroleum-intensive company in such a way as to take from the earth only what can be renewed by the earth, naturally and rapidly -- not another fresh drop of oil -- and to do no harm to the biosphere. But I realized, for that to be true -- for theft of our children's future to be a crime -- there must be a clear, demonstrable alternative to the take-make-waste industrial system that so dominates our civilization, and is the major culprit, stealing our children's future, by digging up the earth and converting it to products that quickly become waste in a landfill or an incinerator -- in short, digging up the earth and converting it to pollution.

442,"Two years ago here at TED I reported that we had discovered at Saturn, with the Cassini Spacecraft, an anomalously warm and geologically active region at the southern tip of the small Saturnine moon Enceladus, seen here. This region seen here for the first time in the Cassini image taken in 2005. And I also reported that we'd made this mind-blowing discovery -- this once-in-a-lifetime discovery of towering jets erupting from those fractures at the south pole, consisting of tiny water ice crystals accompanied by water vapor and simple organic compounds like carbon dioxide and methane. And at that time two years ago I mentioned that we were speculating that these jets might in fact be geysers, and erupting from pockets or chambers of liquid water underneath the surface, but we weren't really sure. However, the implications of those results -- of a possible environment within this moon that could support prebiotic chemistry, and perhaps life itself -- were so exciting that, in the intervening two years, we have focused more on Enceladus. While they're not amino acids, we're now finding things like propane and benzene, hydrogen cyanide, and formaldehyde. So we are very encouraged by these results. And we are much more confident now than we were two years ago that we might indeed have on this moon, under the south pole, an environment or a zone that is hospitable to living organisms. But in the meantime I invite you to imagine the day when we might journey to the Saturnine system, and visit the Enceladus interplanetary geyser park, just because we can.

447,"All these things, they come back to plants. And plants sometimes find it rather difficult to move because there might be cities and other things in the way. So if all human life depends on plants, doesn't it make sense that perhaps we should try to save them? So if you're going to build a seed bank, you have to decide what you're going to store in it. And we decided that what we want to store first of all, are the species that are most under threat. And the main thing is that you have to dry them very carefully, at low temperature. And these seeds will be able to germinate, we believe, with many of the species, in thousands of years, and certainly in hundreds of years. That means that we know the right combination of heat and cold and the cycles that you have to get to make the seed germinate. And then we grow these things, and we tell people, back in the countries where these seeds have come from, ""Look, actually we're not just storing this to get the seeds later, but we can give you this information about how to germinate these difficult plants."" So in habitats that have already been damaged, like the tall grass prairie here in the USA, or in mined land in various countries, restoration is already happening because of these species -- and because of this collection.","a seed bank will store the species that are most under threat. the seeds will be able to germinate with many of the species, in thousands of years. restoration is already happening because of these species.","In this brief talk from TED U 2009, Jonathan Drori encourages us to save biodiversity -- one seed at a time.

456,"It isn't just that. We have a system that is really ancient, and really there for physical danger. Absent from this list, and absent from any discussions of happiness, are happiness in another's happiness. There was once a statement made by a psychologist that said that 80 percent of the pursuit of happiness is really just about the genes, and it's as difficult to become happier as it is to become taller. There is a decent contribution to happiness from the genes -- about 50 percent -- but there is still that 50 percent that is unaccounted for. It turned out that it wasn't, that it really is a system of motivation, a system of wanting. And one of them, of course, is biophilia -- that we have a response to the natural world that's very profound. The other thing is, that a piece of evidence is, is if you look at computerized text analysis of people who commit suicide, what you find there, and it's quite interesting, is use of the first person singular -- ""I,"" ""me,"" ""my,"" not ""we"" and ""us"" -- and the letters are less hopeless than they are really alone.

But then I stopped, because I figured I was this hot-shot guy and I shouldn't have to work at ideas, they should just come like magic. Reaching success, I always focused on clients and projects, and ignored the money. But then I got into stuff that I didn't love, like management. Well, soon a black cloud formed over my head and here I was, outwardly very successful, but inwardly very depressed. So I went back to doing the projects I loved.

So, on the top, we had these beautiful rainforests and an ocean, and underneath we had all this technosphere, we called it, which is where all the pumps and the valves and the water tanks and the air handlers, and all of that. And the doctor was, in fact, checking us to make sure we were, in fact, fine. And it was time for us to put oxygen in. And I slowly lost track of where I was in this big biosphere, in this big biosphere that we all live in. And one of the things we did was try to figure out: how small can you make these biospheres, and what can you do with them? But this is also what I saw.

460,"I want to talk about the transformed media landscape, and what it means for anybody who has a message that they want to get out to anywhere in the world. If you want to address a group, you get the same message and you give it to everybody in the group, whether you're doing that with a broadcasting tower or a printing press. That was the media landscape as we had it in the twentieth century. The Internet is the first medium in history that has native support for groups and conversation at the same time. And the earthquake was reported as it was happening. And so as the quake was happening the news was reported. And the Chinese then, in one of their periods of media openness, decided that they were going to let it go, that they were going to let this citizen reporting fly. And it was produced at such an incredible abundance that there was no way to filter it as it appeared. In a world where media is global, social, ubiquitous and cheap, in a world of media where the former audience are now increasingly full participants, in that world, media is less and less often about crafting a single message to be consumed by individuals. And the choice we face, I mean anybody who has a message they want to have heard anywhere in the world, isn't whether or not that is the media environment we want to operate in.","the internet is the first medium in history that has native support for groups and conversation at the same time. in a world where media is global, social, ubiquitous and cheap, the former audience are now increasingly full participants.","While news from Iran streams to the world, Clay Shirky shows how Facebook, Twitter and TXTs help citizens in repressive regimes to report on real news, bypassing censors (however briefly).

And so after this happened, I decided it was a good time to turn my back on this work. And that was, ""How did this happen to me?"" I understand how someone's brain, how someone's mind can come to the place where it makes sense -- in fact it would be wrong, when your brain is working like that -- not to try to save the world through genocide. And so what is this? For those of you who aren't familiar with memetics, a meme has been defined as an idea that replicates in the human brain and moves from brain to brain like a virus, much like a virus. In 1974, I was young, I was naive, and I was pretty lost in my world. And the thing is, though, if you looked at my brain during those years in the Moonies -- neuroscience is expanding exponentially, as Ray Kurzweil said yesterday. And the reason that gives me hope is that the first thing is to admit that we have a problem.","a meme is an idea that replicates in the human brain and moves from brain to brain like a virus. john sutter: neuroscience is expanding exponentially, as Ray Kurzweil said yesterday. sutter: we need to admit that we have a problem, not to try to save the world through genocide.","Diane Benscoter spent five years as a ""Moonie.""

462,"So in order to give you some kind of a perspective of where we are right now with surgical robots, and where we're going to be going in the future, I want to give you a little bit of perspective of how we got to this point, how we even came to believe that surgery was OK, that this was something that was possible to do, that this kind of cutting and reforming was OK. Because we were in the age before anesthesia, the agony of the patient is really as much of the public spectacle as the surgery itself. So what you see -- this is now the first surgical image -- as we're coming down the tube, this is a new entry into the body. So what you need to do, to take the capability of your hand, and put it on the other side of that small incision, is you need to put a wrist on that instrument. But what this lets you do is gives you that all-important traction, and counter-traction, so that you can dissect, so that you can sew, so that you can do all the things that you need to do, all the surgical tasks. This is all they're going to see. As we take these capabilities, and we get to go to the next places, we get to decide what our new surgeries are going to be. We can inject these dyes into the bloodstream, so that when we do a new vessel and we bypass a blockage on the heart, we can see if we actually made the connection, before we close that patient back up again -- something that we haven't been able to do without radiation before. So this is all very prototypey at this point. So, with the combination of these technologies we can reach it all, and we can see it all.","robots allow surgeons to do all the things they need to do, all the surgical tasks. we can inject dyes into the bloodstream, so we can bypass a blockage on the heart. with the combination of these technologies we can reach it all, and we can see it all.","Surgeon and inventor Catherine Mohr tours the history of surgery (and its pre-painkiller, pre-antiseptic past), then demos some of the newest tools for surgery through tiny incisions, performed using nimble robot hands.

And the problem is that they can become biased, because you learn to over-use some of them and under-use the others. For some people it's only about what is in the immediate situation, what other people are doing and what you're feeling. And those people, when they make their decisions in that format -- we're going to call them ""present-oriented,"" because their focus is what is now. For others it's not the past, it's not the present, it's only about the future. They sacrifice family time. Told me don't eat that marshmallow, because if you wait you're going to get two of them, until I learned to balance out.

It would be ideal to have a standard set of norms where, when we got to a post-conflict situation, there was an expectation of these mutual commitments from the three parties. What is a distinctive approach to generating jobs in post-conflict situations? And why are they upset? There's one sector which isn't exposed to international trade, and which can generate a lot of jobs, and which is, in any case, a sensible sector to expand, post-conflict, and that is the construction sector. If we do that, we not only get the jobs, we get the improvements in public infrastructure, the restoration of public infrastructure. The typical post-conflict government is so short of money that it needs our money just to be on a life-support system. That after 10 years, the focus on the construction sector would have produced both jobs and, hence, security -- because young people would have jobs -- and it would have reconstructed the infrastructure.

477,"And so some of the brains that I've studied are people you know about. The pattern is that those people, every one of them I looked at, who was a murderer, and was a serial killer, had damage to their orbital cortex, which is right above the eyes, the orbits, and also the interior part of the temporal lobe. So there is the pattern that every one of them had, but they all were a little different too. And there is a variant of this gene that is in the normal population. Some of you have this. And so in this way you can only get it from your mother. And what I think might happen in these areas of the world, where we have constant violence, you end up having generations of kids that are seeing all this violence.

478,"Now what is so interesting and to some, the extent, what's a bit infamous about ""The Origin of Species,"" is that there is only one line in it about human evolution. And what Darwin could not appreciate, or didn't perhaps want to appreciate at the time, is that there was a fundamental relationship between the intensity of ultraviolet radiation and skin pigmentation. And that skin pigmentation itself was a product of evolution. So, it's wonderful. This had tremendous consequences for the evolution of human skin pigmentation. What they haven't been so good about instructing people is the problem of darkly pigmented people living in high latitude areas, or working inside all the time. So we have, in skin pigmentation, one of these wonderful products of evolution that still has consequences for us today. But we need to think about how he compares, in terms of his pigmentation, to other people on Earth. Now what is wonderful about the evolution of human skin pigmentation, and the phenomenon of pigmentation, is that it is the demonstration, the evidence, of evolution by natural selection, right on your body. Isn't it wonderful?","gene seymour: evolution of human skin pigmentation is a product of natural selection. he says it shows evolution by natural selection right on your body. seymour: we need to think about how he compares, in terms of his pigmentation, to others on earth.","Nina Jablonski says that differing skin colors are simply our bodies' adaptation to varied climates and levels of UV exposure.

479,"What they have in common is what we see unlocks what we cannot see. What these pictures demonstrate is that there is a moral sense across all religions, across all faiths, across all continents -- a moral sense that not only do we share the pain of others, and believe in something bigger than ourselves but we have a duty to act when we see things that are wrong that need righted, see injuries that need to be corrected, see problems that need to be rectified. We now have the capacity to find common ground with people who we will never meet, but who we will meet through the Internet and through all the modern means of communication; that we now have the capacity to organize and take collective action together to deal with the problem or an injustice that we want to deal with; and I believe that this makes this a unique age in human history, and it is the start of what I would call the creation of a truly global society. She was so appalled by what was happening in Austria as a result of the First World War and what was happening to children who were part of the defeated families of Austria, that in Britain she wanted to take action, but she had to go house to house, leaflet to leaflet, to get people to attend a rally in the Royal Albert Hall that eventually gave birth to Save the Children, an international organization that is now fully recognized as one of the great institutions in our land and in the world. I was with Nelson Mandela a year ago, when he was in London. Is it not absolutely scandalous that we have a situation where we know that there is a climate change problem, where we know also that that will mean we have to give more resources to the poorest countries to deal with that, when we want to create a global carbon market, but there is no global institution that people have been able to agree upon to deal with this problem? (Applause) One of the reasons why an institution is not in itself enough is that we have got to persuade people around the world to change their behavior as well, so you need that global ethic of fairness and responsibility across the generations. We do not have the basis of a proper partnership for the future, and yet, out of people’s desire for a global ethic and a global society that can be done. When you looked in her eyes, any girl at the age of eleven is looking forward to the future, but there was an unreachable sadness in that girl’s eyes and if I could have translated that to the rest of the world for that moment, I believe that all the work that it had done for the global HIV/AIDS fund would be rewarded by people being prepared to make donations. That global ethic can infuse the fairness and responsibility that is necessary for these institutions to work, but we should not lose the chance in this generation, in this decade in particular, with President Obama in America, with other people working with us around the world, to create global institutions for the environment, and for finance, and for security and for development, that make sense of our responsibility to other peoples, our desire to bind the world together, and our need to tackle problems that everybody knows exist.","sally kohn: what we see unlocks what we cannot see. kohn: we have a moral sense across all religions, across all faiths, across all continents. she says we have the capacity to organize and take collective action together. kohn: we have got to persuade people around the world to change their behavior.","We're at a unique moment in history, says UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown: we can use today's interconnectedness to develop our shared global ethic -- and work together to confront the challenges of poverty, security, climate change and the economy."
480,"I'm mentioning all this -- I'm mentioning all this because I think this is not merely a personal problem; you may think I'm wrong in this, but I think we live in an age when our lives are regularly punctuated by career crises, by moments when what we thought we knew -- about our lives, about our careers -- comes into contact with a threatening sort of reality. I want to look now, if I may, at some of the reasons why we might be feeling anxiety about our careers. I think there is. (Laughter) (Applause) In a way, if you like, at one end of the spectrum of sympathy, you've got the tabloid newspaper. And I think that is the message of tragedy to us, and why it's so very, very important, I think. We are the first society to be living in a world where we don't worship anything other than ourselves. And the thing about a successful life is that a lot of the time, our ideas of what it would mean to live successfully are not our own. So what I want to argue for is not that we should give up on our ideas of success, but we should make sure that they are our own. Because it's bad enough not getting what you want, but it's even worse to have an idea of what it is you want, and find out, at the end of the journey, that it isn't, in fact, what you wanted all along. But how do you reconcile this idea of it being bad to think of someone as a ""loser,"" with the idea that a lot of people like, of seizing control of your life, and that a society that encourages that, perhaps has to have some winners and losers?","a lot of the time, our ideas of what it would mean to live successfully are not our own. a lot of the time, our ideas of what it would mean to live successfully are not our own. a lot of people like, of seizing control of their lives, a society that encourages that.","Alain de Botton examines our ideas of success and failure -- and questions the assumptions underlying these two judgments.

There is only one circumstance in which they always, all of them, walk on two legs, and that is when they are wading through water. Well they do know, that if you look at other aquatic mammals, the fat that in most land mammals is deposited inside the body wall, around the kidneys and the intestines and so on, has started to migrate to the outside, and spread out in a layer inside the skin. And the ironic thing about it is that they are not staving off the aquatic theory to protect a theory of their own, which they've all agreed on, and they love. Of course they don't believe it, but they like it."" And they can't all be wrong, can they?""

485,"I want to argue that there is a general abstract insight that we can make practical, which is that, if we can give more choices to people, and more choices to leaders -- who, in many countries, are also people. But if we can find ways to give more choices to both, that will give us a set of rules for changing rules that get us out of traps. And he says that if you want to see the damaging effects of rules, the ways that rules can keep people in the dark, look at the pictures from NASA of the earth at night. If you try to change the rules in a village, you could do that, but a village would be too small to get the kinds of benefits you can get if you have millions of people all working under good rules. We start with a charter that specifies all the rules required to attract the people who we'll need to build the city. This model is all about choices, both for leaders and for the people who will live in these new places. Now, if we generalize this and think about not just one or two charter cites, but dozens -- cities that will help create places for the many hundreds of millions, perhaps billions of people who will move to cities in the coming century -- is there enough land for them? So if we wanted to build cities for another billion people, they would be dots like this. The reason we can be so well off, even though there is so many people on earth, is because of the power of ideas. If we can keep innovating on our space of rules, and particularly innovate in the sense of coming up with rules for changing rules, so we don't get stuck with bad rules, then we can keep moving progress forward and truly make the world a better place, so that people like Nelson and his friends don't have to study any longer under the streetlights.","john avlon: if we can give more choices to people, and more choices to leaders, we can change rules. avlon: if we can find ways to give more choices to both, that will give us a set of rules. he says we can keep innovating on our space of rules so we don't get stuck with bad rules. avlon: if we can keep innovating on our space of rules, we can keep moving progress forward","How can a struggling country break out of poverty if it's trapped in a system of bad rules?

486,"What's happening now, in this field called biomimicry, is that people are beginning to remember that organisms, other organisms, the rest of the natural world, are doing things very similar to what we need to do. It was called the bullet train because it was rounded in front, but every time it went into a tunnel it would build up a pressure wave, and then it would create like a sonic boom when it exited.

In short, the answer is that in the future, in many countries, the coldest growing seasons are going to be hotter than anything those crops have seen in the past. By 2030, if the maize, or corn, varieties, which is the dominant crop -- 50 percent of the nutrition in Southern Africa are still in the field -- in 2030, we'll have a 30 percent decrease in production of maize because of the climate change already in 2030.

And I'm a very small part of a very large movement, which for some people is about survival, but is also about values, about a different kind of economy, which isn't so much about consumption and credit, but about things which matter to us. And everywhere, as people think about the unprecedented sums which are being spent of our money and our children's money, now, in the depth of this crisis, they're asking: Surely, we should be using this with a longer-term vision to accelerate the shift to a green economy, to prepare for aging, to deal with some of the inequalities which scar countries like this and the United States rather than just giving the money to the incumbents? And what people are beginning to ask is: Surely, just as we invest in R and D, two, three, four percent, of our GDP, of our economy, what if we put, let's say, one percent of public spending into social innovation, into elder care, new kinds of education, new ways of helping the disabled? It will become more involved in social investment, and social care and in industries where the value comes from what you do with others, not just from what you sell to them, and from relationships as well as from consumption. But this is one of those very rare moments when we have to choose whether we're just pedaling furiously to get back to where we were a year or two ago, and a very narrow idea of what the economy is for, or whether this is a moment to jump ahead, to reboot and to do some of the things we probably should have been doing anyway.","john avlon: people are asking: Surely we should be using this with a longer-term vision. avlon: we need to accelerate the shift to a green economy, to prepare for aging. avlon: we have to choose whether we're just pedaling furiously to get back to where we were a year ago.","As we reboot the world's economy, Geoff Mulgan poses a question: Instead of sending bailout money to doomed old industries, why not use stimulus funds to bootstrap some new, socially responsible companies -- and make the world a little bit better?"
495,"Now, cymatics is the process of visualizing sound by basically vibrating a medium such as sand or water, as you can see there. He created an experiment using a metal plate, covering it with sand and then bowing it to create the Chladni patterns that you see here on the right. As you can see with your own eyes. (Applause) So, what excites me about cymatics? Through the numerous ways that we can apply cymatics, we can actually start to unveil the substance of things not seen. Devices like the cymascope, which you can see here, have been used to scientifically observe cymatic patterns. This image here is created from a snippet of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony playing through a cymatic device. We can also use cymatics as a looking glass into nature. So, for example, here on the left we can see a snowflake as it would appear in nature. And if we kind of ponder on that, then perhaps cymatics had an influence on the formation of the universe itself.","cymatics is the process of visualizing sound by basically vibrating a medium such as sand or water. we can use cymatics as a looking glass into nature, for example, a snowflake.","Evan Grant demonstrates the science and art of cymatics, a process for making soundwaves visible. Useful for analyzing complex sounds (like dolphin calls), it also makes complex and beautiful designs."
496,"What I'd like to do first is take you through a very brief helicopter ride of stunts and the stunts industry in the movies and in television, and show you how technology has started to interface with the physical skills of the stunt performer in a way that makes the stunts bigger and actually makes them safer than they've ever been before. And that's in the up position. We used to have to drive up a ramp, and we still do sometimes. It's 30 feet. He did a jump from 100,000 feet, 102,000 to be precise, and he did it to test high altitude systems for military pilots in the new range of aircraft that were going up to 80,000 feet or so. Now one of the challenges of going up to altitude is when you get to 30,000 feet -- it's great, isn't it? So I've had to do quite a lot of training. This is what the view is going to be like at 90,000 feet for me. Trying to find a space suit to do this has led me to an area of technology that I never really expected when I set about doing this. I would like to bring Costa on, if he's here, to show you the only one of its kind in the world.","cnn's john sutter takes you on a helicopter ride of stunts and the stunt industry. sutter: technology has interfaced with the physical skills of the stunt performer. he says it makes the stunts bigger and safer than they've ever been before. sutter: ""i would like to bring Costa on to show you the only one of its kind in the world""","At his day job, Steve Truglia flips cars, walks through fire and falls out of buildings -- pushing technology to make stunts bigger, safer, more awesome.

497,"So, having seen all of this in the course of a 30-year career, I was still a skeptic about climate change until about 10 years ago, because I thought the story of climate change was based on computer models. When I realized that climate change was real, and it was not based on computer models, I decided that one day I would do a project looking at trying to manifest climate change photographically. This is what one of our cameras saw over the course of a few months. We're going to be up there in just a few more weeks, and we expect that it's probably retreated another half a mile, but if I got there and discovered that it had collapsed and it was five miles further back, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised. Now it's really hard to grasp the scale of these places, because as the glaciers -- one of the things is that places like Alaska and Greenland are huge, they're not normal landscapes -- but as the glaciers are retreating, they're also deflating, like air is being let out of a balloon. That's what you see with these cameras. So that's where we started three years ago, way out on the left, and that's where we were a few months ago, the last time we went into Columbia. And here, if you watch, you can see the terminus retreating. The one glacier up in Greenland that puts more ice into the global ocean than all the other glaciers in the northern hemisphere combined is the Ilulissat Glacier. It's hard to get it.","glaciers retreat, deflate, like air is being let out of a balloon. one glacier up in Greenland puts more ice into the global ocean than all the other glaciers. photographer: ""we're going to be up there in just a few more weeks""","Photographer James Balog shares new image sequences from the Extreme Ice Survey, a network of time-lapse cameras recording glaciers receding at an alarming rate, some of the most vivid evidence yet of climate change."
498,"He could tell a story about an event, and so you felt you were absolutely there at the moment. Some people think that swimming is a very solo sport, you just dive into the sea and off you go. And I remember taking the goggles off my face and looking down at my hands in sheer shock, because my fingers had swollen so much that they were like sausages. And this dream which I had had ever since I was a young boy with my father, was just going out the window. And my close friend David, he saw the way I was thinking, and he came up to me and he said, ""Lewis, I've known you since you were 18 years old. I've known you, and I know, Lewis, deep down, right deep down here, that you are going to make this swim. Lewis, have the courage to go in there, because we are going to look after you every moment of it."" And I just, I got so much confidence from him saying that, because he knew me so well. But was it worth it? The second thing we need to do is we need to just look back at how far we have come in such a short period of time.","bob greene: some people think that swimming is a very solo sport, you just dive into the sea. greene: we need to look back at how far we have come in such a short period of time. he says we need to look back at how far we have come in such a short period of time. greene: we need to look back at how far we have come in such a short period of time.",Lewis Pugh talks about his record-breaking swim across the North Pole.

499,"So that's a problem in philosophy, but for today's purposes I'm going to assume that many people in this audience have a mind, and that I don't have to worry about this. Or to say, as Alan Greenspan did, ""I know you think you understand what you thought I said, but I'm not sure you realize that what you heard is not what I meant."" So first, the first thing I want to tell you is that there is a brain region in the human brain, in your brains, whose job it is to think about other people's thoughts. (Laughter) The second thing I want to say about this brain system is that although we human adults are really good at understanding other minds, we weren't always that way. Ivan comes back and he says, ""I want my cheese sandwich."" Child: I think he is going to take that one. RS: And Ivan says, ""I want my cheese sandwich."" (Laughter) And now what we've started to do in my lab is to put children into the brain scanner and ask what's going on in their brain as they develop this ability to think about other people's thoughts. So that's good, but of course what we'd rather is have a way to interfere with function in this brain region, and see if we could change people's moral judgment. But in the case of a failed attempt to harm, where Grace thought that it was poison, although it was really sugar, people now say it was more okay, she deserves less blame for putting the powder in the coffee.","a brain region in the human brain is whose job it is to think about other people's thoughts. child: we humans are really good at understanding other minds, but we weren't always that way. child: we've started to put children into the brain scanner and ask what's going on in their brains.","Sensing the motives and feelings of others is a natural talent for humans.
