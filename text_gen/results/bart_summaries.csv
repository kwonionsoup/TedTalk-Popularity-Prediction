0,"I started thinking about my father and my grandfather and my great-grandfather, and I realized that I had all of these Teds going through my bloodstream -- (Laughter) that I had to consider this ""my element."" This is what you see. And when I started my blog, it was really this one goal -- I said, ""I am not going to be famous to the world, but I could be famous to people on the Internet."" And I won it -- I reached all of these people, and I had tens of thousands of people reading about my life every day. Because the joke in this is that this person is not a tyrant, this person is so loving and so sweet that he lets me dress him up and post pictures of him to my blog. These things resonate with us, and, if you think about blogs, you think of high art blogs, the history paintings about, you know, all the biblical stories, and then you have this. And we started with a slide of my Teds, and I had to add this slide, because I knew the minute I showed this, my mom -- my mom will see this, because she does read my blog and she'll say, ""Why wasn't there a picture of me?"" So, I have all the people that I know of. And to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs; to think about the people that are on those $100 computers, talking about who they are, sharing these personal stories -- this is an amazing thing. So I do something that's very narcissistic -- I am a blogger -- that is an amazing thing for me, because it captures a moment in time every day. But this is amazing, because I can go back to a day -- to April 2005, and say, what was I doing this day? And the last story I really want to tell is this story, because this is probably the one that means the most to me in all of what I'm doing. But the big thing that really influenced us was, her sister wrote to me, and she said -- and she wrote on this blog -- that writing her blog during the last couple of months of her life was probably the best thing that had happened to her, and being able to talk to people and to share what was going on, and being able to write and receive comments. And that was amazing, to be able to know that we had empowered that, and that blogging was something that she felt comfortable doing, and the idea that blogging doesn't have to be scary, that we don't always have to be attack of the blogs, that we can be people who are open, and wanting to help and talk to people. So, this is her legacy, and I think that my call to action to all of you is: think about blogs, think about what they are, think about what you've thought of them, and then actually do it, because it's something that's really going to change our lives.","I started thinking about my father and my grandfather and my great-grandfather, and I realized that I had all of these Teds going through my bloodstream.

1,"I have been blown away by this conference, and I want to thank all of you for the many nice comments about what I had to say the other night. (Laughter) The very next day, continuing the totally true story, I got on a G-V to fly to Africa to make a speech in Nigeria, in the city of Lagos, on the topic of energy. And I told it pretty much the same way I've just shared it with you: Tipper and I were driving ourselves, Shoney's, low-cost family restaurant chain, what the man said -- they laughed. And I thought to myself, in the middle of the night, in the middle of the Atlantic, what in the world could be wrong in Washington? (Laughter) But what it turned out to be, was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech, and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America. (Applause) Al Gore: I want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on: What can you do about the climate crisis? Cars and trucks -- I talked about that in the slideshow, but I want you to put it in perspective. It's an easy, visible target of concern -- and it should be -- but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks. OK. Now, what can you do? Those of you who are good at branding, I'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people. A lot more to be said about that. And so I'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse, in communities all across the country, and we're going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week, to keep it right on the cutting edge. This used to be a bipartisan issue, and I know that in this group it really is.

3,"And the idea there is that outside the spaceship, the universe is implacably hostile, and inside is all we have, all we depend on, and we only get the one chance: if we mess up our spaceship, we've got nowhere else to go. Well, is this a typical place? All you've got to do is go a few hundred miles in that same direction and look back, and you won't see any walls or chemical scum at all -- all you see is a blue planet. And if you go further than that, you'll see the Sun, the solar system and the stars and so on, but that's still not typical of the universe, because stars come in galaxies. What does a ""typical"" place in the universe look like? It's so dark, that if you were to be looking at the nearest star to you, and that star were to explode as a supernova, and you were to be staring directly at it at the moment when its light reached you, you still wouldn't be able to see even a glimmer. (Laughter) And yet, from intergalactic space, it's so far away you wouldn't even see it. Now, how do we know about an environment that's so far away and so different and so alien from anything we're used to? Now, that is knowledge. And so, far from being insignificant, the fact that the laws of physics allow this or even mandate that this can happen is one of the most important things about the physical world. But the thing is, in a comprehensible universe, if something isn't forbidden by the laws of physics, then what could possibly prevent us from doing it, other than knowing how? Well, again, it's dark out there to human senses, but all you've got to do is take a telescope, even one of present-day design, look out, and you'll see the same galaxies as we do from here. Any such cube anywhere in the universe could become the same kind of hub that we are, if the knowledge of how to do so were present there. Now, I don't think that probability is the right category to discuss this issue in, but I do agree with him about this: we can survive and we can fail to survive. And if we want to be the exception to that, then logically, our only hope is to make use of the one feature that distinguishes our species and civilization from all the others, namely, our special relationship with the laws of physics, our ability to create new explanations, new knowledge -- to be a hub of existence.","The universe is implacably hostile, and inside is all we have, all we depend on, and we only get the one chance: if we mess up our spaceship, we've got nowhere else to go.

4,"I can't help but this wish: to think about when you're a little kid, and all your friends ask you, ""If a genie could give you one wish in the world, what would it be?"" But in 2003, when the war in Iraq was about to start, it was a very surreal feeling for me, because before the war started, there was kind of this media war that was going on. I didn't even have a camera at the time -- I had somebody bring it there, because I wanted to get access to Al Jazeera, George Bush's favorite channel, and a place which I was very curious about because it's disliked by many governments across the Arab world, and also called the mouthpiece of Osama Bin Laden by some people in the US government. So, the impact that had on me -- me realizing that I just saw people on the other side, and those people in the Al Jazeera office must have felt the way I was feeling that night, and it upset me on a profound level that I wasn't as bothered as much the night before. You know, we're criticized abroad for believing we're the saviors of the world in some way, but the flip side of it is that, actually, when people do see what is happening abroad and people's reactions to some of our policy abroad, we feel this power, that we need to -- we feel like we have to get the power to change things. I saw the bombs being loaded on the planes, I saw the military going out to war, but you don't understand people's anger towards us until you see the people in the hospitals and the victims of the war, and how do we get out of this bubble? But I know the power of it, I know that it starts people thinking about how to change the world. Now, I'm not a philosopher, so I feel like I shouldn't go into great depth on this, but let film speak for itself and take you to this other world. And that's what this is about. There's Working Films and there's Current TV, which is an incredible platform for people around the world to be able to put their -- (Applause) Yeah, it's amazing. And if film can do that, and if we can get all of these different locations in the world to watch these films together -- this could be an incredible day. Now, we've thought about a name for this day, and I'd like to share this with you. And if you just imagine that all of these people in these towns would be watching, then I think that we can actually really make a movement towards people understanding each other better. I know that it's very intangible, touching people's hearts and souls, but the only way that I know how to do it, the only way that I know how to reach out to somebody's heart and soul all across the world, is by showing them a film.

5,"And so I want to tell you about that first, and then go on into where I think love is going. (Laughter) ""What 'tis to love?"" (Laughter) And then you just focus on this person. You can list what you don't like about them, but then you sweep that aside and focus on what you do. It would be nice to go to bed with them, but you want them to call you on the telephone, to invite you out, etc., to tell you that they love you.

6,"Women love to talk about their vaginas, they do. It began with a conversation with a woman. I think if you had told me when I was younger that I was going to grow up, and be in shoe stores, and people would scream out, ""There she is, the Vagina Lady!"" (Laughter) But I want to talk a little bit about happiness, and the relationship to this whole vagina journey, because it has been an extraordinary journey that began eight years ago. I think what I learned from talking about the vagina and speaking about the vagina, is it was the most obvious thing -- it was right in the center of my body and the center of the world -- and yet it was the one thing nobody talked about. What women lined up to tell me was how they were raped, and how they were battered, and how they were beaten, and how they were gang-raped in parking lots, and how they were incested by their uncles. What I have learned is two things: one, that the epidemic of violence towards women is shocking; it's global; it is so profound and it is so devastating, and it is so in every little pocket of every little crater, of every little society that we don't even recognize it, because it's become ordinary. What has also happened is in the course of these travels -- and it's been an extraordinary thing -- is that every single place that I have gone to in the world, I have met a new species. (Laughter) But one of the things I've seen is this species -- and it is a species, and it is a new paradigm, and it doesn't get reported in the press or in the media because I don't think good news ever is news, and I don't think people who are transforming the planet are what gets the ratings on TV shows. And it's been really interesting to be in my head for the last two days; I've been very disoriented -- (Laughter) because I think the world, the V-world, is very much in your body. And she came, and she witnessed this, and she decided that she would go back and leave her husband, and that she would bring V-Day to Guatemala.

7,"And that was: What is the purpose of this? And all of the sudden, it brought a lot of money and a lot of attention. And when I started the church, you know, I had no plans to do what it's doing now. And then when I wrote this book, and all of a sudden, it just took off, and I started saying, now, what's the purpose of this? I just don't believe that.

8,"It is in this spirit that I join into a discussion of one of the critical issues of our time, namely, how to mobilize different forms of capital for the project of state building. But we are not dealing with the implications of the one world that we are living in. And that is that if we want to have one world, this one world cannot be based on huge pockets of exclusion, and then inclusion for some. Otherwise we will be missing this open moment in history, where we have a consensus on both the form of politics and the form of economics. Textbook economics does not work in my context, and I have very few recommendations from anybody as to how to put together a legal economy. Now, the issue that should concern us here -- and that's the challenge that I would like to pose to this group -- is again, it takes 16 years in your countries to produce somebody with a B.S. And I hope that this group would be able to deal with the issue of state and development and the empowerment of the majority of the world's poor, through this means.

11,"To explain the wish, I'm going to have to take you somewhere where many people haven't been, and that's around the world. Many architects seemed to think that when you design, you design a jewel, and it's a jewel that you try and crave for; whereas I felt that when you design, you either improve or you create a detriment to the community in which you're designing. So you're not just doing a building for the residents or for the people who are going to use it, but for the community as a whole. And I didn't know what I was doing -- like I said, mid-20s -- and I'm the Internet generation, so we started a website. (Laughter) So what you don't know is, we've got these thousands of designers working around the world, connected basically by a website, and we have a staff of three. This is Kosovo in '99. The idea is it's not just a clinic, it's a community center. They said, this is our design, because it's not only about engaging a community; it's about empowering a community, and about getting them to be a part of the rebuilding process. And what that means is we actually live and work with the community, and they're part of the design process. So this is all done in the last two years. And this is just a selection of things that were built in the last couple of years. And what that means is that a designer can -- The Siyathemba project I showed was the first ever building to have a Creative Commons license on it. Because you know what? So it's going to take a lot of computing power, because I want the idea that any laptop anywhere in the world can plug into the system and be able to not only participate in developing these designs, but utilize the designs. And so, you know, I want these -- I just should note: I have two laptops and one of them is there, and that has 3000 designs on it.","I felt that when you design, you either improve or you create a detriment to the community in which you're designing.

12,"But the students are not there. (Laughter) This is where I realized that there was really a need to communicate, because the data of what's happening in the world and the child health of every country is very well aware. Because my students, what they said when they looked upon the world, and I asked them, ""What do you really think about the world?"" We have very good data since 1962, 1960, about, on the size of families in all countries. Can you see there? But in the middle, we have most of the world population, and they have now 24 percent of the income. This is Africa. And you have the OECD there, and you have sub-Saharan Africa there, and we take off the Arab states there, coming both from Africa and from Asia, and we put them separately, and we can expand this axis, and I can give it a new dimension here, by adding the social values there, child survival. Now I have money on that axis, and I have the possibility of children to survive there. And if we move back again, here, and we put trails on them, like this, you can see again that the speed of development is very, very different, and the countries are moving more or less at the same rate as money and health, but it seems you can move much faster if you are healthy first than if you are wealthy first. Now, this is, more or less, if you look at the average data of the countries -- they are like this. So if I go and look here, we can see that Uganda today is where South Korea was in 1960. But this is what we would like to see, isn't it? What has happened is this: that China is growing, it's not so equal any longer, and it's appearing here, overlooking the United States, almost like a ghost, isn't it? These countries are lifting more than the economy, and it will be very interesting to follow this over the year, as I would like you to be able to do with all the publicly funded data.","The data of what's happening in the world and the child health of every country is very well aware.

13,"You don't do book talks at TED, but I'm going to have just one slide about my book, because there is one message in it which I think this group really needs to hear. I don't think so. They don't have to be. It doesn't have to be. And there was a passage in it which he did not present here and I think it is so good, I'm going to read it to you: ""Over billions of years on a unique sphere, chance has painted a thin covering of life: complex, improbable, wonderful and fragile. And what I want to do now is say a bit about this book from the design standpoint, because I think it's actually a brilliant book. There are lots of people out there who don't have purpose in their life, and bringing purpose to their life is a wonderful goal. And the means -- how does he do it? This is the evolution of religion that's been going on for thousands of years, and he's just the latest brilliant practitioner of it. I don't have to tell you this; you just heard the man. We don't need a belief in God to be good or to have meaning in us. I'm afraid that a lot of people take that sentiment to mean that we don't have to do the sorts of things that Al Gore is trying so hard to get us to do. So I'm sort of thinking, ""Well, I don't know, I don't know if I want to get upset with this yet."" And what I find deeply troubling in this book is that he seems to be arguing that if you want to be moral, if you want to have meaning in your life, you have to be an Intelligent Designer, you have to deny the theory of evolution by natural selection. I don't believe it and I think this idea, popular as it is -- not in this guise, but in general -- is itself one of the main problems that we face.","""We don't need a belief in God to be good or to have meaning i"" ""Over billions of years on a unique sphere, chance has painted a thin covering of life: complex, improbable, wonderful and fragile"" ""I'm afraid that a lot of people take that sentiment to mean that we don't have to do the sorts of things that Al Gore is trying so hard to get us to do,"" he says.

14,"So this is what the supermarket is like. And do you know what the answer to this question now is? What do you want to do?"" What do you want to do?"" And you say, ""If you were me, Doc, what would you do?"" And that means that every day, when you wake up in the morning, you have to decide what kind of person you want to be. (Laughter) We all know what's good about it, so I'm going to talk about what's bad about it. The second effect is that, even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice, we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from. One of them is, with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from, if you buy one and it's not perfect -- and what salad dressing is? All this choice made it possible for me to do better. When there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available and you buy one that is disappointing and you ask why, who's responsible, it is equally clear that the answer to the question is ""you."" I believe a significant -- not the only, but a significant -- contributor to this explosion of depression and also suicide, is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high, and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves, they think they're at fault. But it doesn't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice. There are lots of places in the world, and we have heard about several of them, where their problem is not that they have too much choice. Because the truth of the matter is, if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible, you don't have freedom.","Every day, when you wake up in the morning, you have to decide what kind of person you want to be.

15,"And the idea is that you, within that continuum, identify a series of points, and you design specifically to them. Now I'm going to talk about -- I'm going to build up the Seattle Central Library in this way before your eyes in about five or six diagrams, and I truly mean this is the design process that you'll see. Ok, now, this I'll come back to later, but something -- actually, the librarians at first said, ""No, this isn't our mandate. So what you're seeing now is actually the design of the building.

By pulling a string, it vibrates and produces a sound wave, which passes through a piece of wood called a bridge, and goes down to the wood box and gets amplified, but ... let me think. (Laughter) OK, this is sort of technology, but I can call it a 16th-century technology. I remember when I was little, my mom asked me, ""Would you like to play the violin or the piano?"" The best of all is that if I don't want to practice, (Whispering) I can hide it. (Laughter) The violin is very beautiful. But whether you like it or not, it's been so for more than 400 years, unlike modern stuff [that] easily looks dated. I mean, when I first got my violin and tried to play around on it, it was actually really bad, because it didn't sound the way I'd heard from other kids -- it was so horrible and so scratchy. So, it wasn't entertaining at all. But besides, my brother found this very funny: Yuk! After Mr. Heifetz's concert, a lady came over and complimented him: ""Oh, Mr. Heifetz, your violin sounded so great tonight!""

17,"I'll show you some stuff that's just ready to come out of the lab, literally, and I'm really glad that you guys are going to be among the first to see it in person, because I really think this is going to really change the way we interact with machines from this point on. You know, like that. What's really interesting here is what you can do with it and the kind of interfaces you can build on top of it. Now what's great about a multi-touch sensor is that, you know, I could be doing this with as many fingers here, but of course multi-touch also inherently means multi-user. You can imagine a new kind of sculpting tool, where I'm kind of warming something up, making it malleable, and then letting it cool down and solidifying in a certain state. Now, when you have initiatives like the $100 laptop, I kind of cringe at the idea of introducing a whole new generation to computing with this standard mouse-and-windows-pointer interface. This is something that I think is really the way we should be interacting with machines from now on. (Laughter) And I can bring that around, put that up there. This is going to be really important as we start getting to things like data visualization. And one of the reasons why I think that is will be helped by things like graphics and visualization and inference tools, but I also think a big part of it is going to be having better interfaces, to be able to drill down into this kind of data, while still thinking about the big picture here. So, again, with a multi-point interface, you can do a gesture like this -- so you can be able to tilt around like that -- (Surprised laughter) It's not just simply relegated to a kind of 2D panning and motion. We just came up with that on the spot, it's probably not the right thing to do, but there's such interesting things you can do with this interface. (Laughter) And so the last thing I want to show you is -- I'm sure we can all think of a lot of entertainment apps that you can do with this thing. It's kind of a puppeteering thing, where I can use as many fingers as I have to draw and make -- Now, there's a lot of actual math going on under here for this to control this mesh and do the right thing.

18,"I want to start with a story, a la Seth Godin, from when I was 12 years old. So when Chris raised to me how wonderful everything that was happening in the world, that we were seeing a shift in zeitgeist, on the one hand I absolutely agree with him, and I was so thrilled to see what happened with the G8 -- that the world, because of people like Tony Blair and Bono and Bob Geldof -- the world is talking about global poverty; the world is talking about Africa in ways I have never seen in my life. And if you remember one thing from what I want to talk about today, it's that the only way to end poverty, to make it history, is to build viable systems on the ground that deliver critical and affordable goods and services to the poor, in ways that are financially sustainable and scaleable. And I want to talk a little bit about that, and some of the examples, so you can see what it is that we're doing. That's who we talk about when we think about ""the poor."" One is in India, where there are 240 million farmers, most of whom make less than two dollars a day. They now make four dollars a day, which is pretty much middle class for India, and they showed me the concrete foundation they had just laid to build their house. We can send people to the moon; we can see if there's life on Mars -- why can't we get five-dollar nets to 500 million people? On the distribution side, though, as a world, we have a lot of work to do. And so, when I told her about our idea -- that maybe we could take a Tupperware model from the United States, and find a way for the women themselves to go out and sell these nets to others -- she quickly started calculating what she herself could make and signed up. She brought 10 of the women with whom she interacts together to see if she could sell these nets, five dollars apiece, despite the fact that people say nobody will buy one, and we learned a lot about how you sell things. And we've started making curtains, and not only is it beautiful, but people can see status -- that you care about your children. Because at the end of the day, it's about engagement. It's about understanding that people really don't want handouts, that they want to make their own decisions; they want to solve their own problems; and that by engaging with them, not only do we create much more dignity for them, but for us as well. And so I urge all of you to think next time as to how to engage with this notion and this opportunity that we all have -- to make poverty history -- by really becoming part of the process and moving away from an us-and-them world, and realizing that it's about all of us, and the kind of world that we, together, want to live in and share.","The only way to end poverty is to build viable systems on the ground that deliver critical and affordable goods and services to the poor.

Well, because Mr. Anderson told me that this session is called ""Sync and Flow,"" I was wondering, ""What do I know that these geniuses don't?"" What I do first is, I make a lot of little musical ideas you can just improvise here at the piano -- and I choose one of those to become my main theme, my main melody, like the Abegg that you just heard. And once I choose my main theme, I have to decide: Out of all the styles in music, what kind of style do I want? And then you want to decide: How are you going to draw the character? Am I going to draw it on the computer? And then you have to do the initial sketch of the character, which is like your structure of a piece, and then you add pen and pencil, and whatever details that you need -- that's polishing the drawing. And another thing that both of these have in common is your state of mind, because I know I'm one of those teenagers that are really easily distracted. So if I'm trying to do homework and I don't feel like it, I'll try to draw or, you know, waste my time.

20,"And so we're going to have to do a lot of work that goes beyond just the Internet. And the reason for this is that most people understand the need for neutrality. And I said -- you know, I always say, please don't do that. So how do we do this? The reason for this is if we say we're only going to write the ""truth"" about some topic, that doesn't do us a damn bit of good of figuring out what to write, because I don't agree with you about what's the truth. So this neutrality policy is really important for us because it empowers a community that is very diverse to come together and actually get some work done. This is really important because a lot of new pages are just garbage that has to be deleted, you know, ""ASDFASDF."" So we do have edits by anonymous users, which is one of the most controversial and intriguing things about Wikipedia. Is it what? This is not really a vote so much as it is a dialogue.

So the Wikipedia governance model, the governance of the community, is a very confusing, but workable mix of consensus -- meaning we try not to vote on the content of articles, because the majority view is not necessarily neutral -- some amount of democracy -- all of the administrators -- these are the people who have the ability to delete pages. So as an example of how this can be important: we recently had a situation where a neo-Nazi website discovered Wikipedia, and they said, ""Oh, well, this is horrible, this Jewish conspiracy of a website, and we're going to get certain articles deleted that we don't like. And we see they have a voting process, so we're going to send -- we have 40,000 members and we're going to send them over and they're all going to vote and get these pages deleted.""

21,"I'm Rich Baraniuk and what I'd like to talk a little bit about today are some ideas that I think have just tremendous resonance with all the things that have been talked about the last two days. But I'm not here to talk about music today. I'm here to talk about books. So, that's what I'd like to talk about and, really, how we get from where we are now to where we need to go. And then take that material and imagine making it all open, so that people can modify it, play with it, improve it. Imagine making it free, so that anyone in the world can have access to all of this knowledge, and imagine using information technology so that you can update this content, improve it, play with it, on a timescale that's more on the order of seconds instead of years. So that we could truly build an ecosystem with not just authors, but all the people who could be or want to be authors in all the different languages of the world, and I think if you could do this, it would be called -- I'm just going to refer to it as a knowledge ecosystem. So, really, this is the dream, and in a sense what you can think of it is we're trying to enable anyone in the world, I mean anyone in the world -- (Laughter) to be their own educational DJ, creating educational materials, sharing them with the world, constantly innovating on them. Over the last six-and-a-half years, we've been working really hard at Rice University on a project called Connexions, and so what I'd like to do for the rest of the talk is just tell you a little bit about what people are doing with Connexions, which you can kind of think of as the counterpoint to Nicholas Negroponte's talk yesterday, where they're working on the hardware of bringing education to the world. OK, what about people who are mixing? And to them, this idea of being able to remix and customize to the local context is extraordinarily important, because just providing free content to people has actually been likened by people in the developing world to a kind of cultural imperialism -- that if you don't empower people with the ability to re-contextualize the material, translate it into their own language and take ownership of it, it's not good. And I think that really, in a sense, what we're trying to do is make Minsky's dream come to a reality, where you can imagine all the books in a library actually starting to talk to each other. So, what we have to do is get it right from the very beginning. In fact, you're free to share it, to do all of these things: to copy it, to change it, even to make commercial use of it, as long as you attribute the author. All of you here are tremendously imbued with tremendous amounts of knowledge, and what I'd like to do is invite each and every one of you to contribute to this project and other projects of its type, because I think together we can truly change the landscape of education and educational publishing.","Rich Baraniuk: I think there are some ideas that have just tremendous resonance with all the things that have been talked about the last two days.

22,"And then I'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk talking about, you know, how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong, namely, by actually doing something about it. Now the thing is, I would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging. You know, if you haven't got an argument that's that strong, then just don't waste my time, is what I say. And that's why we have to really talk about this a lot -- evangelize, I will go so far as to say, quite a lot -- in order to get people's attention, and make people realize that they are in a trance in this regard. So that's all I'm going to say about that. So we can put it this way: we can say that, you know, we have this chain of events. Because, you know, most people, when they hear that I predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to 1,000 or more, they think that I'm saying that we're going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are so thoroughly eliminating aging that those therapies will let us live to 1,000 or more. If you're already 100, or even if you're 80 -- and an average 80-year-old, we probably can't do a lot for you with these therapies, because you're too close to death's door for the really initial, experimental therapies to be good enough for you. So this is a genuine conclusion that I come to, that the first 150-year-old -- we don't know how old that person is today, because we don't know how long it's going to take to get these first-generation therapies. And this is what it is. So in order to tell you now how we're going to get these mice, I'm going to add a little bit to my description of aging. So, these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago and that is pretty good news, because it means that, you know, we've come a long way in biology in these 20 years, so the fact that we haven't extended this list is a pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done. I haven't got time to go through them at all, but my conclusion is that, if we can actually get suitable funding for this, then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only 10 years, but we do need to get serious about it. So if you think that I'm wrong, you'd better damn well go and find out why you think I'm wrong. And I think we know how to do it.","The main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging.

This is the most important slide that I've ever seen in public health, [Sovereigns killed by smallpox] because it shows you to be the richest and the strongest, and to be kings and queens of the world, did not protect you from dying of smallpox. But this was in 1974, and as of that moment, this photograph was the photograph that was the most widely printed, because we printed two billion copies of this photograph, and we took them hand to hand, door to door, to show people and ask them if there was smallpox in their house, because that was our surveillance system. There are 20 million people on the road at any time, in buses and trains, walking; 500,000 villages, 120 million households, and none of them wanted to report if they had a case of smallpox in their house, because they thought that smallpox was the visitation of a deity, Shitala Mata, the cooling mother, and it was wrong to bring strangers into your house when the deity was in the house. When we didn't search, we had the illusion that there was no disease. Would you get in an airplane with 250 people you didn't know, coughing and sneezing, when you knew that some of them might carry a disease that could kill you, for which you had no antivirals or vaccine? Now, if we had an ""undo"" button, and we could go back and isolate it and grab it when it first started -- if we could find it early, and we had early detection and early response, and we could put each one of those viruses in jail -- that's the only way to deal with something like a pandemic. And that simulation that I showed you that you thought was bird flu -- that was SARS. (Applause) But in all seriousness, because this idea is birthed in TED, I would like it to be a legacy of TED, and I'd like to call it the ""International System for Total Early Disease Detection."" So instead of a hidden pandemic of bird flu, we find it and immediately contain it. And we'll grow it as a moral force in the world, finding out those terrible things before anybody else knows about them, and sending our response to them, so that next year, instead of us meeting here, lamenting how many terrible things there are in the world, we will have pulled together, used the unique skills and the magic of this community, and be proud that we have done everything we can to stop pandemics, other catastrophes, and change the world, beginning right now. Now, what's really important is that, before there was GPHIN, 100 percent of all the world's reports of bad things -- whether you're talking about famine or you're talking about bird flu or you're talking about Ebola -- 100 percent of all those reports came from nations. The moment these guys in Ottawa -- on a budget of 800,000 dollars a year -- got cracking, 75 percent of all the reports in the world came from GPHIN, 25 percent of all the reports in the world came from all the other 180 nations. I want to add all the languages of the world that we possibly can. And I want to make it part of our culture that there is a community of people who are watching out for the worst nightmares of humanity, and that it's accessible to everyone.","This is the most important slide that I've ever seen in public health.

25,"What I'm going to tell you today is that, in fact, based on 10 years of research, a unique opportunity to go inside a gang -- to see the actual books, the financial records of the gang -- that the answer turns out not to be that being in the gang was a glamorous life. And then third, I want to tell you, in a very superficial way, about some of the things we found when we actually got to look at the financial records, the books, of the gang. To do that, you have to actually go back to a time before crack cocaine, in the early '80s, and look at it from the perspective of a gang leader. But the thing is, there was no money in it. I don't have time to talk about it today, but if you think about it, I would say that in the last 25 years, of every invention or innovation that's occurred in this country, the biggest one in terms of impact on the well-being of people who live in the inner city, was crack cocaine. And it turned out there was this audience that didn't know it wanted crack cocaine, but when it came, it really did. So for fifteen minutes, you get this great high, and then when you come down, all you want to do is get high again. And for the people who were there running the gang, it was a great way, seemingly, to make a lot of money. This is a very dangerous job, being in a gang. We got an inside look at the gang, from the very bottom up to the very top. So if I have to kind of summarize very quickly in the short time I have what the bottom line of what I take away from the gang is, it's that, if I had to draw a parallel between the gang and any other organization, it would be that the gang is just like McDonald's, in a lot of different respects -- the restaurant McDonald's. (Laughter) And Sudhir says it's not like these guys had a very sophisticated view of what happened in American corporate life, but they had seen movies like ""Wall Street,"" and they had learned a little bit about what it was like to be in the real world. So in some sense, the foot soldiers are a lot like the people who are taking your order at McDonald's, and it's not just by chance that they're like them. It wasn't his money -- until he spent it, and then he was in debt to the gang, and was sort of an indentured servant for a while.

26,"And I think -- so I want to throw a perspective that I have, so that we can assess this project, or any other project, for that matter, to see whether it's contributing or -- contributing to poverty or trying to alleviate it. And so you can see, the real process of -- and this is backed up by this 500-page book -- that the authorities came down and citizens got up. But if you look, if you have that perspective, then you can see what happened in the last 60 years. And if you agree with that, then I think the best way to improve these countries is to recognize that economic development is of the people, by the people, for the people. If you just multiply by 100 million people, let's say losing one day a month, whatever, and you see a vast amount of resource wasted. The question was, how much did it cost to install a new telephone in Bangladesh? I mean, in America, people buy cars, and they put very little money down. They get a car, and they go to work. In the United States, we have -- everybody needs a banking service, but very few of us are trying to buy a bank. So we could do that for telephones. But that's what's lacking in a poor country. I mean, of course there might be other good reasons, but this was one of the reasons -- they had to be. What is it that they really do?

29,"Now one of the reasons why there are so few trees is this: people need to cook, and they harvest wood and they make charcoal in order to do it. And so this is what they do. And one of the things that they found was they didn't burn. And more than in Haiti, this produces really smoky fires, and this is where you see the health impacts of cooking with cow dung and biomass as a fuel. Well, unfortunately, they didn't have sugarcane and they didn't have cassava, but that didn't stop us. And what we could use as a binder was actually small amounts of cow manure, which they used ordinarily for their fuel. So now we're in a situation where we have a product, which is actually better than what you can buy in Haiti in the marketplace, which is a very wonderful place to be. So what is this? They can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal and they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who aren't making their own. So when we talk about, now, the future we will create, one of the things that I think is necessary is to have a very clear vision of the world that we live in.

30,"Yet the assumptions that quantum theory needs to make in order to deliver those predictions are so mysterious that even Feynman himself was moved to remark, ""If you think you understand quantum theory, you don't understand quantum theory."" We never evolved to navigate in the world of atoms. (Laughter) We are evolved denizens of Middle World, and that limits what we are capable of imagining.

I don't think we shall have to avail ourselves of that, because I suspect that life is quite common in the universe.

31,"So I thought that it will be good to start with it. Think about that number: 83 percent of the population on the whole planet does not really know what is going on in their countries. But what they really do, which is very powerful, and that is what governments in the late '90s started doing if they don't like independent media companies -- you know, they threaten your advertisers. At that time at the beginning of the '90s, we had that problem, which was, you know, survival below one side, but what was really painful for me was, remember, the beginning of the '90s, Yugoslavia is falling apart. And I thought, I'm just dumb and I cannot find it. I have -- I left the country, I have a meeting with George Soros, trying for the third time to convince him that his foundation should invest in something that should operate like a media bank. And second, that I have no idea how to make it work. So I thought, why don't we get into that business? They want to -- the only way for them to survive is to get a printing press.

I was asked by Chris to talk about some of the big issues, and so I figured I'd start with the three that at least drove me to do this. Whereas at about the age six, we were told to stop learning that way, and that all learning from then on would happen through teaching, whether it's people standing up, like I'm doing now, or a book, or something. And one of the things in general that computers have provided to learning is that it now includes a kind of learning which is a little bit more like walking and talking, in the sense that a lot of it is driven by the learner himself or herself.

35,"They got on and didn't know where they were going, and ended up in Canada. So from that moment on, I read every medical book I could get my hands on, and I just loved it so much. I wanted it all at once, but knew I couldn't really get that. So, if the body is sensing that you have damage to an organ and then it's initiating cancer, it's almost as if this is a repair response. If somehow we can cause these cells to differentiate -- to become bone tissue, lung tissue, liver tissue, whatever that cancer has been put there to do -- it would be a repair process. But it struck me that I'd never heard of cancer of the heart, or cancer of any skeletal muscle for that matter. And so at first I kind of thought, ""Well, maybe there's some obvious explanation why skeletal muscle doesn't get cancer -- at least not that I know of."" Some articles even went as far as to say that skeletal muscle tissue is resistant to cancer, and furthermore, not only to cancer, but of metastases going to skeletal muscle. Some of my hypotheses are that when you first think about skeletal muscle, there's a lot of blood vessels going to skeletal muscle. And one article that really stood out to me when I was just reading about this, trying to figure out why cancer doesn't go to skeletal muscle, was that it had reported 16 percent of micro-metastases to skeletal muscle upon autopsy. Meaning that there were these pinpoint tumors in skeletal muscle, but only .16 percent of actual metastases -- suggesting that maybe skeletal muscle is able to control the angiogenesis, is able to control the tumors recruiting these blood vessels. So this suggests that maybe if there is an anti-angiogenic factor in skeletal muscle -- or perhaps even more, an angiogenic routing factor, so it can actually direct where the blood vessels grow -- this could be a potential future therapy for cancer. Now, one thing that kind of ties the resistance of skeletal muscle to cancer -- to the cancer as a repair response gone out of control in the body -- is that skeletal muscle has a factor in it called ""MyoD."" So, is it possible that the tumor cells are going to the skeletal muscle tissue, but once in contact inside the skeletal muscle tissue, MyoD acts upon these tumor cells and causes them to become skeletal muscle cells? Maybe tumor cells are being disguised as skeletal muscle cells, and this is why it seems as if it is so rare.","If the body is sensing that you have damage to an organ and then it's initiating cancer, it's almost as if this is a repair response.

36,"And, I noticed that most inventions fail, not because the R&amp;D department can't get it to work -- if you look at most business plans, they will actually succeed if given the opportunity to build what they say they're going to build -- and 90 percent of those projects or more will fail, because the timing is wrong -- not all the enabling factors will be in place when they're needed. But Moore's Law, which is very often identified with this exponential growth, is just one example of many, because it's basically a property of the evolutionary process of technology. It took us three years to double our price performance of computing in 1900, two years in the middle; we're now doubling it every one year. You would think it would be a very erratic process, and you have a very smooth outcome of this chaotic process. They're faster, so you've got exponential growth in the speed of transistors, so the cost of a cycle of one transistor has been coming down with a halving rate of 1.1 years. And it's not just computers. So, life -- long lifespans -- like, that is to say, much more than 30 -- weren't selected for, but we are learning to actually manipulate and change these software programs through the biotechnology revolution. Once we understand its principles of operation, and the pace with which we are reverse-engineering biology is accelerating, we can actually design these things to be thousands of times more capable. It will be interesting to see what we do in our Olympic trials. There's actually one going into human trial, so this is feasible technology. This is at an early stage, but you can show with the exponential growth of the amount of information about the brain and the exponential improvement in the resolution of brain scanning, we will succeed in reverse-engineering the human brain by the 2020s. Wall Street noticed that this was a revolutionary technology, which it was, but then six months later, when it hadn't revolutionized all business models, they figured, well, that was wrong, and then we had this bust. But if we go to 2029, we really have the full maturity of these trends, and you have to appreciate how many turns of the screw in terms of generations of technology, which are getting faster and faster, we'll have at that point. We'll have completed the reverse-engineering of the human brain, 1,000 dollars of computing will be far more powerful than the human brain in terms of basic raw capacity. These are very powerful technologies.","Moore's Law is just one example of many, because it's basically a property of the evolutionary process of technology.

(Laughter) What we're looking forward to is -- (Applause) what we're looking forward to is not only the inspiration of our children, but the current plan right now is not really even allowing the most creative people in this country -- the Boeing's and Lockheed's space engineers -- to go out and take risks and try new stuff. Well, what did I do when I was a kid? And I had to fly three in Mojave with my little group of a couple dozen people in order to get to a total of five, which was the number the same year back in 1961. Our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that. And I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and try that as a small company. Because the moon doesn't have an atmosphere -- you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by 10 feet if you want. For a whole decade it was for fun -- we didn't even know what it was for. There's a group of people that have come forward -- and you don't know all of them -- but the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children, this little three- to 15-year-old age, by us going to orbit and going to the moon here, right in this time period. These people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area, and I think it's a lot better than they put it in an area of a better cell phone or something -- but they're putting it in very -- areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability, and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it will allow us to explore. What's out there is there's something really interesting going to happen here. The fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance has been, well, you know, you win the war in 12 minutes; why do you need something better? But the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first. The fact that we had the hardware to put something in orbit when we let Von Braun fly it -- you can argue that's not a technical loss.

39,"But I think the most important one is that London was this city of 2.5 million people, and it was the largest city on the face of the planet at that point. Not just because of the cesspools, but also the sheer number of livestock in the city would shock people. So, you would just walk around London at this point and just be overwhelmed with this stench. So what ended up happening, actually, is they ended up increasing the outbreaks of cholera because, as we now know, cholera is actually in the water. So this was the state of London in 1854, and in the middle of all this carnage and offensive conditions, and in the midst of all this scientific confusion about what was actually killing people, it was a very talented classic 19th century multi-disciplinarian named John Snow, who was a local doctor in Soho in London, who had been arguing for about four or five years that cholera was, in fact, a waterborne disease, and had basically convinced nobody of this. Snow lived near there, heard about the outbreak, and in this amazing act of courage went directly into the belly of the beast because he thought an outbreak that concentrated could actually potentially end up convincing people that, in fact, the real menace of cholera was in the water supply and not in the air. And he managed to track down, Whitehead did, many of the cases of people who had drunk water from the pump, or who hadn't drunk water from the pump. And eventually Snow made a map of the outbreak. And he thought about representing that as a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods, people who hadn't, you know, percentages of people who hadn't, but eventually he hit upon the idea that what he needed was something that you could see. Something that would take in a sense a higher-level view of all this activity that had been happening in the neighborhood. And so, with the help of this map, and with the help of more evangelizing that he did over the next few years and that Whitehead did, eventually, actually, the authorities slowly started to come around. It took much longer than sometimes we like to think in this story, but by 1866, when the next big cholera outbreak came to London, the authorities had been convinced -- in part because of this story, in part because of this map -- that in fact the water was the problem. When people were looking at 10 percent of their neighborhoods dying in the space of seven days, there was a widespread consensus that this couldn't go on, that people weren't meant to live in cities of 2.5 million people. But because of what Snow did, because of this map, because of the whole series of reforms that happened in the wake of this map, we now take for granted that cities have 10 million people, cities like this one are in fact sustainable things. We don't worry that New York City is going to collapse in on itself quite the way that, you know, Rome did, and be 10 percent of its size in 100 years or 200 years.","London was the largest city on the face of the planet at that point.

41,"It is, first of all, profoundly unequal: half the world's people still living on less than two dollars a day; a billion people with no access to clean water; two and a half billion no access to sanitation; a billion going to bed hungry every night; one in four deaths every year from AIDS, TB, malaria and the variety of infections associated with dirty water -- 80 percent of them under five years of age. So this interdependent world which has been pretty good to most of us -- which is why we're all here in Northern California doing what we do for a living, enjoying this evening -- is profoundly unequal. When the terrorist incidents occurred in the United Kingdom a couple of years ago, I think even though they didn't claim as many lives as we lost in the United States on 9/11, I think the thing that troubled the British most was that the perpetrators were not invaders, but homegrown citizens whose religious and political identities were more important to them than the people they grew up with, went to school with, worked with, shared weekends with, shared meals with. When I organized my foundation, and I thought about the world as it is and the world that I hope to leave to the next generation, and I tried to be realistic about what I had cared about all my life that I could still have an impact on. (Applause) When I got out of office and was asked to work, first in the Caribbean, to try to help deal with the AIDS crisis, generic drugs were available for about 500 dollars a person a year. Now we can get it for about 100 dollars. The systems are not there to reach the people. So what we have been trying to do, working first in Rwanda and then in Malawi and other places -- but I want to talk about Rwanda tonight -- is to develop a model for rural health care in a very poor area that can be used to deal with AIDS, TB, malaria, other infectious diseases, maternal and child health, and a whole range of health issues poor people are grappling with in the developing world, that can first be scaled for the whole nation of Rwanda, and then will be a model that could literally be implemented in any other poor country in the world. And two, will it do it at a price that will enable the country to sustain a health care system without foreign donors after five to 10 years? The person, in my view, who has done the best job of this in the health care area, of building a system in a very poor area, is Dr. Paul Farmer, who, many of you know, has worked for now 20 years with his group, Partners in Health, primarily in Haiti where he started, but they've also worked in Russia, in Peru and other places around the world. Because it seemed to me if we could prove there was a model in Haiti and a model in Rwanda that we could then take all over the country, number one, it would be a wonderful thing for a country that has suffered as much as any on Earth in the last 15 years, and number two, we would have something that could then be adapted to any other poor country anywhere in the world. That's 80 percent of the people who need treatment in this area. About 40 percent of all the people -- I said 400,000. About 40 percent of all the people who need TB treatment are now getting it -- in just 18 months, up from zero when we started.

42,"The second school I was at had big trees too, had a fantastic tulip tree, I think it was the biggest in the country, and it also had a lot of wonderful bushes and vegetation around it, around the playing fields. One day I was grabbed by some of my classmates, and taken in the bushes -- I was stripped; I was attacked; I was abused; and this came out of the blue. And 30 years later I was sitting in an airplane, next to a lady called Veronica, who came from Chile, and we were on a human rights tour, and she was starting to tell me what it was like to be tortured, and, from my very privileged position, this was the only reference point that I had. And it was an amazing learning experience because, for me, human rights have been something in which I had, you know, a part-time interest, but, mainly, it was something that happened to other people over there. But I got a phone call from Bono in 1985 and, as you know, he's a great singer, but he's a magnificent hustler, and -- (Laughter) -- a very hard guy to say no to, and he was saying, you know, just after I'd done the Biko song, we're going to do a tour for Amnesty, you have to be on it, and really that was the first time that I'd been out and started meeting people who'd watched their family being shot in front of them, who'd had a partner thrown out of an airplane into an ocean, and suddenly this world of human rights arrived in my world, and I couldn't really walk away in quite the same way as before. But the thing that really amazed me, that I had no idea, was that you could suffer in this way and then have your whole experience, your story, denied, buried and forgotten. And Reebok set up a foundation after these Human Rights Now tours and there was a decision then -- well, we made a proposal, for a couple of years, about trying to set up a division that was going to give cameras to human rights activists. (Music) Woman: Life in the camp is never simple. as they beat us. Anyway, WITNESS has been trying to arm the brave people who often put their lives at risk around the world, with cameras, and I'd like to show you just a little more of that. You can say you don't trust newspapers. But you can't say what you just saw never happened. And we've also been trying to get computers out to the world, so that groups can communicate much more effectively, campaign much more effectively, but now we have the wonderful possibility, which is given to us from the mobile phone with the camera in it, because that is cheap; it's ubiquitous; and it's moving fast all around the world -- and it's very exciting for us. And so, the dream is that we could have a world in which anyone who has anything bad happen to them of this sort has a chance of getting their story uploaded, being seen, being watched, that they really know that they can be heard, that there would be a giant website, maybe, a little like Google Earth, and you could fly over and find out the realities of what's going, for the world's inhabitants. In a way what this technology is allowing is, really, that a lot of the problems of the world can have a human face, that we can actually see who's dying of AIDS or who's being beaten up, for the first time, and we can hear their stories in a way that the blogger culture -- if we can move that into these sort of fields, I think we can really transform the world in all sorts of ways.","The singer was abused by classmates when he was at school in Chile.

43,"So here's what you do. When they say to you, ""What do you do?"" What I want to do more generally is to get you thinking about the place of uncertainty and randomness and chance in our world, and how we react to that, and how well we do or don't think about it.

Amongst all these other people who don't have the disease, the test will get it right 99 percent of the time. And the number we end up with -- that number which is a little bit less than one in 100 -- is to do with how likely one of those explanations is relative to the other. And just to set it in context, you can imagine how awful it is for someone to have lost one child, and then two, if they're innocent, to be convicted of murdering them. It's like saying, ""If you toss a coin and get a head the first time, that won't affect the chance of getting a head the second time."" So after Sally Clark was convicted -- you can imagine, it made rather a splash in the press -- one of the journalists from one of Britain's more reputable newspapers wrote that what the expert had said was, ""The chance that she was innocent was one in 73 million.""

Here we have our device in which we put in a frame. And then with four screws, we put in a frame, then we snap in the device and we run with wires -- the one shown in green will go to the surface of the brain with electrodes, to the epileptic focus, the origin of the epilepsy, where we can sense the electrical signal and have computer analysis that tells us when to hit it with some electrical current to prevent the clinical manifestation of the seizure.

45,"If they'd sent a nuke, it would have been rather more spectacular than what actually happened last Monday. In six billion years, the sun will look like that. If my research group had a logo, it would be this picture here: an ouroboros, where you see the micro-world on the left -- the world of the quantum -- and on the right the large-scale universe of planets, stars and galaxies. (Laughter) And until we have that synthesis, we won't be able to understand the very beginning of our universe because when our universe was itself the size of an atom, quantum effects could shake everything. And so we need a theory that unifies the very large and the very small, which we don't yet have. One idea, incidentally -- and I had this hazard sign to say I'm going to speculate from now on -- is that our Big Bang was not the only one. And so we believe that there may be a lot more to physical reality than what we've normally called our universe -- the aftermath of our Big Bang. And here's another picture. Bottom right depicts our universe, which on the horizon is not beyond that, but even that is just one bubble, as it were, in some vaster reality. It would take as many human bodies to make up the sun as there are atoms in each of us. The science of complexity is probably the greatest challenge of all, greater than that of the very small on the left and the very large on the right. And so what this means is that we have to accept the risks if we are going to enjoy the benefits of science. There's an unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will be there, experiencing the sun's demise, but any life and intelligence that exists then will be as different from us as we are from bacteria.

46,"(Laughter) What I'm going to tell you about in my 18 minutes is how we're about to switch from reading the genetic code to the first stages of beginning to write the code ourselves. We can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours. We just got a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to sequence 130 genomes this year, as a side project from environmental organisms. And maybe it's something that people in Oxford don't do very often, but if you ever make it to the sea, and you swallow a mouthful of seawater, keep in mind that each milliliter has about a million bacteria and on the order of 10 million viruses. We just take seawater and we filter it, and we collect different size organisms on different filters, and then take their DNA back to our lab in Rockville, where we can sequence a hundred million letters of the genetic code every 24 hours. Just on the data collection side, just where we are through the Galapagos, we're finding that almost every 200 miles, we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean. Just to try and get an assessment of what our gene repertoire was, we assembled all the data -- including all of ours thus far from the expedition, which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet -- and it totaled around 29 million genes. Of those roughly 29 million genes, we only have around 24,000 in our genome. Synthetic DNA, the ability to synthesize DNA, has changed at sort of the same pace that DNA sequencing has over the last decade or two, and is getting very rapid and very cheap. So we made a map of all the genes that could take transposon insertions and we called those ""non-essential genes."" But it turns out the environment is very critical for this, and you can only define an essential or non-essential gene based on exactly what's in the environment. The only way to prove these ideas was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them, and we had to do this in a cassette-based fashion. This was not the first synthetic virus -- a polio virus had been made a year before -- but it was only one ten-thousandth as active and it took three years to do. For example, from the third organism we sequenced, Methanococcus jannaschii -- it lives in boiling water temperatures; its energy source is hydrogen and all its carbon comes from CO2 it captures back from the environment. So we know lots of different pathways, thousands of different organisms now that live off of CO2, and can capture that back.","We can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours. We just got a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to sequence 130 genomes this year. We can sequence a hundred million letters of the genetic code every 24 hours. s diversity in the samples in the ocean. Of those roughly 29 million genes, we only have around 24,000 in our genome.

That's still conventional bits, the step after that is -- this is an earlier prototype in the lab; this is high-speed video slowed down. We all know we've had a digital revolution, but what is that? And that's when we got the Internet. That's in 2D. Computers that don't control tools but computers that are tools, where the output of a program rearranges atoms as well as bits. You know, hundreds of people came in begging, all my life I've been waiting for this class; I'll do anything to do it. Then they'd ask, can you teach it at MIT? Do you ever find yourself in a situation where you really have to scream, but you can't because you're at work, or you're in a classroom, or you're watching your children, or you're in any number of situations where it's just not permitted? This is a student who made a machine that makes machines, and he made it by making Lego bricks that do the computing. You don't need this for what you can get in Wal-Mart; you need this for what makes you unique. This wasn't meant to be provocative or important, but we put together these Fab Labs. You can see it in their face, just this joy of, I can do it. I was showing my kids in a Fab Lab how to use it. So, we're just at the edge of this digital revolution in fabrication, where the output of computation programs the physical world.","We've had a digital revolution but we don't need to keep having it.

48,"(Laughter) And this man, he has been outside, but he's gone back, and he was saying, ""You know, we have suddenly jumped into a whole new era, and we didn't even know about the white man 50 years ago, and now here we are with laptop computers, and there are some things we want to learn from the modern world. We want to know about what other people do -- we're interested in it. So in many, many ways, we can do things today that we couldn't do when I began in 1960. But the point is that when I was first in Gombe in 1960 -- I remember so well, so vividly, as though it was yesterday -- the first time, when I was going through the vegetation, the chimpanzees were still running away from me, for the most part, although some were a little bit acclimatized -- and I saw this dark shape, hunched over a termite mound, and I peered with my binoculars. What we find is that over these 40-odd years that I and others have been studying chimpanzees and the other great apes, and, as I say, other mammals with complex brains and social systems, we have found that after all, there isn't a sharp line dividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom. The one thing we have, which makes us so different from chimpanzees or other living creatures, is this sophisticated spoken language -- a language with which we can tell children about things that aren't here. We can do it by talking to each other; we can do it through video; we can do it through the written word. As I was traveling around the world, you know, I had to leave the forest -- that's where I love to be. And I have three little grandchildren, and when some of these students would say to me at high school or university, they'd say, ""We're angry,"" or ""We're filled with despair, because we feel you've compromised our future, and there's nothing we can do about it."" Every one of us impacts the world around us everyday, and you scientists know that you can't actually -- even if you stay in bed all day, you're breathing oxygen and giving out CO2, and probably going to the loo, and things like that -- you're making a difference in the world. Because they're buying into it, and they're the ones who get to decide what they're going to do. We want to learn about animals. And I believe that a group like this can have a very major impact, not just because you can share technology with us, but because so many of you have children. And if you take this program out, and give it to your children, they have such a good opportunity to go out and do good, because they've got parents like you. And then as I went around the country after that and felt the fear -- the fear that was leading to people feeling they couldn't worry about the environment any more, in case they seemed not to be patriotic -- and I was trying to encourage them, somebody came up with a little quotation from Mahatma Gandhi, ""If you look back through human history, you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good.""","In 1960, when I was first in Gombe in 1960, the chimpanzees were still running away from me, for the most part.

49,"It wasn't until I actually did a book and a retrospective exhibition, that I could track exactly -- looks like all the craziest things that I had done, all my drinking, all my parties -- they followed a straight line that brings me to the point that actually I'm talking to you at this moment. You know, I was born in Brazil and grew up in the '70s under a climate of political distress, and I was forced to learn to communicate in a very specific way -- in a sort of a semiotic black market. And also -- advertising people do that all the time -- (Laughter) -- and I -- well, what happened is when I went back, it was on the way back to my car, the guy who got hit decided to grab a gun -- I don't know why he had a gun -- and shoot the first person he decided to be his aggressor. And that's how -- with this money I paid for a ticket to come to the United States in 1983, and that's very -- the basic reason I'm talking to you here today: because I got shot. Because when I decided to go into advertising, I wanted to do -- I wanted to airbrush naked people on ice, for whiskey commercials, that's what I really wanted to do. (Laughter) But I -- they didn't let me do it, so I just -- you know, they would only let me do other things. I wanted to take that into the realm of images, and I decided to make things that had the same identity conflicts. So I decided to do work with clouds. So I decided to make these very simple renderings, that at first they are taken as a line drawing -- you know, something that's very -- and then I did it with wire. Because I was doing this while I was making these pictures, I realized that I could add still another thing I was trying to make a subject -- something that would interfere with the themes, so chocolate is very good, because it has -- it brings to mind ideas that go from scatology to romance. And so I decided to make these pictures, and they were very large, so you had to walk away from it to be able to see them. You know? I was more interested in the things in between, you know, because you can leave an enormous range for ambiguity there. And this is another thing that I did -- you know working -- everybody loves to watch somebody draw, but not many people have a chance to watch somebody draw in -- a lot of people at the same time, to evidence a single drawing. And in this, you'd have like a -- something that looks like a cloud, and it is a cloud at the same time.","It wasn't until I actually did a book and a retrospective exhibition, that I could track exactly -- looks like all the craziest things that I had done.

50,"I don't know about you, but I haven't quite figured out exactly what technology means in my life. Every single thing that we can think of -- and if you heard Olivia's talk about the sexual habits, you'll realize that there isn't anything we can say that's true for all life, because every single one of them is hacking something about it. But we see that each one of these is actually hacking, and has a different way of finding out how to do life. One of the things about evolution is that nowhere on Earth have we ever been where we don't find life. And if we were to do that, we would find out -- we could actually approach technology in this way. And it turns out that that's so distinctive that you can actually look at this tree, and you can actually use it to determine that this is a technological system versus a biological system. I mean, it was just -- it was really there. That's what it's for. And when we take that, we take this idea of what culture is doing and add it to what the long-term trajectory -- again, in life's evolution -- we find that each case -- each of the major transitions in life -- what they're really about is accelerating and changing the way in which evolution happens. So what's happening over time in life is that the ways in which you generate these new ideas, these new hacks, are increasing. That's what it's about. All the things that we think that we really like about humanity is being driven by technology. This is the infinite game. You see, technology is a way to evolve the evolution. And so when I think about what technology wants, I think that it has to do with the fact that every person here -- and I really believe this -- every person here has an assignment.","Every single thing that we can think of -- and if you heard Olivia's talk about the sexual habits, you'll realize that there isn't anything we can say that's true for all life.

51,"(Laughter) So the way it works is you go down the hallway, and you see if it tilts toward a particular locker, and then you open the locker.

And if it looks a lot like a Buick hubcap, it's because it is.

Second of all, his data was grainy and fuzzy, and he couldn't quite make out what he was looking at. It wasn't till Huygens had two things: He had a good theory of planetary rings and how the solar system operated, and he had better telescopic, more fine-grain data in which he could figure out that as the Earth is going around faster -- according to Kepler's Laws -- than Saturn, then we catch up with it.

52,"And I must say, before I go on, I should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because I'm actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that. And if we do not, the question I think we need to ask ourselves -- and that's why it's on the economy session -- is to say, if we don't do all things, we really have to start asking ourselves, which ones should we solve first? But of course, there's a problem in asking people to focus on problems. The point that I would like to ask you to try to do, is just in 30 seconds -- and I know this is in a sense an impossible task -- write down what you think is probably some of the top priorities. But if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first, you can't ask either of them, because that's not what they do. So this is the list, and this is the one I'd like to share with you. But it's saying that what we can do about it is very little, at a very high cost. And just to give you a sense of reference, the U.N. actually estimate that for half that amount, for about 75 billion dollars a year, we could solve all major basic problems in the world. It's not to say that if we had all the money in the world, we wouldn't want to do it. It would do a lot of good, but it's also very, very costly. So I'd like to show you the top four priorities which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world. Again, what this does and what it focuses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV/AIDS. I think we should do all things, but we don't. To start thinking about saying, ""Let's do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost, not the things that we don't know how to do, but let's do the great things where we can do an enormous amount of good, at very low cost, right now."" At the end of the day, you can disagree with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these, but we have to be honest and frank about saying, if there's some things we do, there are other things we don't do.","If we don't do all things, we really have to start asking ourselves, which ones should we solve first?

53,"If we were to wipe out insects alone, just that group alone, on this planet -- which we are trying hard to do -- the rest of life and humanity with it would mostly disappear from the land. By my college years, I was a devoted myrmecologist, a specialist on the biology of ants, but my attention and research continued to make journeys across the great variety of life on Earth in general -- including all that it means to us as a species, how little we understand it and how pressing a danger that our activities have created for it. About 16,000 species of nematode worms have been discovered and diagnosed by scientists; there could be hundreds of thousands of them, even millions, still unknown. But that number of bacteria species can be found in one gram of soil, just a little handful of soil, in the 10 billion bacteria that would be there. We are living on a planet with a lot of activities, with reference to our living environment, done by faith and guess alone. Already what were thought to be bacteria for generations have been found to compose, instead, two great domains of microorganisms: true bacteria and one-celled organisms the archaea, which are closer than other bacteria to the eukaryota, the group that we belong to. They've had billions of years to do it, but especially during the earliest period of biological evolution on this planet. I realized then that these species and a large part of the other unique, marvelous animals and plants on that island -- and this is true of practically every part of the world -- which took millions of years to evolve, are in the process of disappearing forever. For example, even in the United States, the 200,000 species known currently actually has been found to be only partial in coverage; it is mostly unknown to us in basic biology. We urgently need to change this. We need to have the biosphere properly explored so that we can understand and competently manage it. What is the ""Encyclopedia of Life?"" It is an encyclopedia that lives on the Internet and is contributed to by thousands of scientists around the world.

56,"And to be honest, if I had known when I was asked to give this upbeat talk that even as I was giving the upbeat talk, the apocalypse would be unfolding -- (Laughter) -- I might have said, ""Is it okay if I talk about something else?"" Social structure adapts to accommodate this possibility and to harness this productive potential, so you get cities, you know, and you get all the non-zero-sum games you don't think about that are being played across the world. Now, this sounds like an intrinsically upbeat worldview in a way, because when you think of non-zero, you think win-win, you know, that's good. But there's a more fundamental reason that it's not intrinsically upbeat, because a non-zero-sum game, all it tells you for sure is that the fortunes will be correlated for better or worse. I kind of think this is a kind of a business-class morality. And by that I mean, if people in the Muslim world get more hateful, more resentful, less happy with their place in the world, it'll be bad for the West. That's what's responsible for this growth of this moral progress so far, and I'm saying we once again have a correlation of fortunes, and if people respond to it intelligently, we will see the development of tolerance and so on -- the norms that we need, you know. So, these two things, you know, if they get people's attention and drive home the positive correlation and people do what's in their self-interests, which is further the moral evolution, then they could actually have a constructive effect. To really understand it, you've got to say, ""Oh, I get it. It's especially hard to do when people hate you, OK, because you don't really, in a sense, want to completely understand why people hate you. (Laughter) You don't want to say, ""Well, yeah, I can kind of understand how a human being in those circumstances would hate the country I live in."" That's not a pleasant thing, but I think it's something that we're going to have to get used to and work on.

So -- (Laughter) -- I mean, we're going to have to work on a lot of fronts, but if we succeed -- if we succeed -- then once again, non-zero-sumness and the recognition of non-zero-sum dynamics will have forced us to a higher moral level.

57,"Brilliant later today -- I want to talk about the other pandemic, which is cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension -- all of which are completely preventable for at least 95 percent of people just by changing diet and lifestyle. Heart and blood vessel diseases still kill more people -- not only in this country, but also worldwide -- than everything else combined, and yet it's completely preventable for almost everybody. It's not only preventable; it's actually reversible. We showed a few months ago -- we published the first study showing you can actually stop or reverse the progression of prostate cancer by making changes in diet and lifestyle, and 70 percent regression in the tumor growth, or inhibition of the tumor growth, compared to only nine percent in the control group. Now there is an epidemic of obesity: two-thirds of adults and 15 percent of kids. What's really concerning to me is that diabetes has increased 70 percent in the past 10 years, and this may be the first generation in which our kids live a shorter life span than we do.

59,"And when I met her, she had just taken a walk over the Himalayas from Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, into Nepal, across to India -- 30 days -- to meet her leader, the Dalai Lama. And it really impressed me -- I met him two weeks after he got out of prison -- that he went through that experience, and ended up with the demeanor that he had. And this is -- well, at the time -- I did this 10 years ago -- that was 36 years after the Dalai Lama had left. As a teenager, he faced the invasion of his country, and had to deal with it -- he was the leader of the country. And we spent -- I was with a team -- two weeks with these guys out in the jungle watching them hunt. And these people are the people who take the brunt of it. And I was -- I usually travel alone when I do my work, but I did this -- I hosted a program for Discovery, and when I went down with the team, I was quite concerned about going in with a whole bunch of people, especially into the Huaorani, deep into the Huaorani tribe. By the way, Mengatoue was the shaman of his tribe as well. So, one thing we did five years ago: we started a program that links kids in indigenous communities with kids in the United States. And the way we do it is, we do it in workshops, and we bring people who want to learn digital workflow and storytelling, and have them work with the kids. This is all their movies. And this is in Takaungu -- we've got a generator and a digital projector, and we're projecting it up against a barn, and showing one of the movies that they made. And if you get a chance, you can go to our website, and you'll see the incredible work these kids do. And this is a study that was just done a couple of years ago.

60,"So, upon landing -- this was still at the old Hong Kong airport that's Kai Tak, when it was smack in the middle of the city -- I thought, ""If I see something good, I'm going to have a great time here in my two weeks. And it turned out that -- I just went to see, you know, what they are doing in Hong Kong. You know, of course, they are related to this combination of at least two of them being, you know, design objects. And, you know, there's a scale of happiness when you talk about in design but the motorcycle incident would definitely be, you know, situated somewhere here -- right in there between Delight and Bliss. And one way to see how happy designers are when they're designing could be to look at the authors' photos on the back of their monographs? And the theory was that if you abstract an image, you really, you know open as much room for the un-representable -- and, therefore, you know, are able to involve the viewer more. Now, what I took away from the exhibit was that maybe with the exception of the mandala most of the pieces in there were actually about the visualization of happiness and not about happiness. It has gotten to the point where, you know, within advertising or within the movie industry, ""happy"" has gotten such a bad reputation that if you actually want to do something with the subject and still appear authentic, you almost would have to, you know, do it from a cynical point of view. (Laughter) So this is one. This is at P.S. But my last project is, again, from a young designer in New York. (Laughter) Well, there was a question, of course, that was on my mind for a while: You know, can I do more of the things that I like doing in design and less of the ones that I don't like to be doing? And then we did one more of these. This is: ""Having"" -- this is the same thing; it's just, you know, photographed from the side.

61,"But what I think it was telling me is that we are this transient thing that's happening, and that the nature that you see out there -- the untouched shorelines, the untouched forest that I was able to see -- really bring in a sense of that geological time, that this has gone on for a long time, and we're experiencing it in a different way. And that, to me, was a reference point that I think I needed to have to be able to make the work that I did. There's something that we're not seeing there. It was the largest one. And I decided to start looking at something that, to me, had -- if the earlier work of looking at the landscape had a sense of lament to what we were doing to nature, in the recycling work that you're seeing here was starting to point to a direction. And I was shut out of India because of a Greenpeace situation there, and then I was able to get into Bangladesh, and saw for the first time a third world, a view of it, that I had never actually thought was possible. And again, I started to think that -- there was another epiphany -- that the whole world I was living in was a result of having plentiful oil. And that, to me, was again something that I started building on, and I continued to build on. What it is, it's a landscape that is an intentional one. So they'll put 20 or 40 up at a time, and they just go up in the same way as a single-family dwelling would go up here in an area. That condition's going to be there for the next 10 to 15 years if they realize what they want, which is, you know, 400 to 500 million more people coming into the cities. These are just recently shot -- I just came back about a month ago, so you're the first ones to be seeing these, these new factory pictures I've taken. And as much as there are great things around the corner -- and it's palpable in this room -- of all of the things that are just about to break that can solve so many problems, I'm really hoping that those things will spread around the world and will start to have a positive effect.

62,"What I'd like to start off with is an observation, which is that if I've learned anything over the last year, it's that the supreme irony of publishing a book about slowness is that you have to go around promoting it really fast. Because everyone these days wants to know how to slow down, but they want to know how to slow down really quickly. (Laughter) And if you think about how we to try to make things better, what do we do? No, we speed them up, don't we? And even things that are by their very nature slow -- we try and speed them up too. And if you go beyond sort of the country level, down at the micro-company level, more and more companies now are realizing that they need to allow their staff either to work fewer hours or just to unplug -- to take a lunch break, or to go sit in a quiet room, to switch off their Blackberrys and laptops -- you at the back -- mobile phones, during the work day or on the weekend, so that they have time to recharge and for the brain to slide into that kind of creative mode of thought. But thankfully, there is a backlash there in parenting as well, and you're finding that, you know, towns in the United States are now banding together and banning extracurriculars on a particular day of the month, so that people can, you know, decompress and have some family time, and slow down. But that said, of course, it's not that easy to slow down, is it? I guess what the Slow Movement -- the purpose of the Slow Movement, or its main goal, really, is to tackle that taboo, and to say that yes, sometimes slow is not the answer, that there is such a thing as ""bad slow."" But the new idea, the sort of revolutionary idea, of the Slow Movement, is that there is such a thing as ""good slow,"" too. Because people at the top of the chain, people like you, I think, are starting to realize that there's too much speed in the system, there's too much busyness, and it's time to find, or get back to that lost art of shifting gears. In the developing world, in countries that are on the verge of making that leap into first world status -- China, Brazil, Thailand, Poland, and so on -- these countries have embraced the idea of the Slow Movement, many people in them, and there's a debate going on in their media, on the streets. Because I think they're looking at the West, and they're saying, ""Well, we like that aspect of what you've got, but we're not so sure about that."" So all of that said, is it, I guess, is it possible? And I now find that bedtime stories used to be a box on my to-do list, something that I dreaded, because it was so slow and I had to get through it quickly.","Everyone these days wants to know how to slow down. More and more companies are realizing that they need to allow their staff to unplug. Even things that are by their very nature slow -- we try and speed them up too.

That the success of sliced bread, like the success of almost everything we've talked about at this conference, is not always about what the patent is like, or what the factory is like -- it's about can you get your idea to spread, or not. And I think that the way you're going to get what you want, or cause the change that you want to change, to happen, is to figure out a way to get your ideas to spread.

And this is an idea, if you think about it, can only fill you with hope. It's the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species. And I know there's some of you who say, ""Well, wouldn't it be better, wouldn't the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language?"" And so, what I'd like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere, a brief journey through the ethnosphere, to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost. Now, there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say ""different ways of being,"" I really do mean different ways of being. But, what makes Voodoo so interesting is that it's this living relationship between the living and the dead. And at the end of this amazing initiation, one day they're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives, at the age of 18, they see a sunrise. There's not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamps of the Asmat or in the chilling winds of Tibet, but they have, nevertheless, through time and ritual, forged a traditional mystique of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-consciously close to it, but on a far subtler intuition: the idea that the Earth itself can only exist because it is breathed into being by human consciousness. Now, if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities, you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries. And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy and they say, ""I thought you knew something about plants. Wherever you look around the world, you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away; these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to: whether it's the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the Penan -- a nomadic people from Southeast Asia, from Sarawak -- a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago, and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers, where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of Borneo away to the South China Sea, where the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest -- or, in the case of the Yanomami, it's the disease entities that have come in, in the wake of the discovery of gold. And it's within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are: a fully conscious species, fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish.

67,"And now I've had a little bit of time to think about it, I would have said, ""Well, you know, if we look at the next 100 years and we've seen all these problems in the last few days, most of the big issues -- clean water, clean energy -- and they're interchangeable in some respects -- and cleaner, more functional materials -- they all look to me to be hardware problems. So, this talk is going to be about how do we make things and what are the new ways that we're going to make things in the future. Now, TED sends you a lot of spam if you're a speaker about ""do this, do that"" and you fill out all these forms, and you don't actually know how they're going to describe you, and it flashed across my desk that they were going to introduce me as a futurist. And I was laughing about this with the very smart colleagues I have, and said, ""You know, well, if I have to talk about the future, what is it?"" Well, it turns out biology has this other very interesting meme, that you can take a linear string, which is a convenient thing to copy, and you can fold that into an arbitrarily complex 3D structure. Now, hopefully, those of you who know anything about graph theory can look at that, and that will satisfy you that that can also do arbitrary 3D structure, and in fact, you know, I can now take a dog, carve it up and then reassemble it so it's a linear string that will fold from a sequence. And how do we think about materials and structure, sort of as an information and computation problem? So, this sort of thinking about structure as computation and structure as information leads to other things, like this. Just by thinking about the physics of the world, materials as the computer, you can start to do things like this. One thing I'm really interested about this right now is, how, if you're really taking this view of the universe as a computer, how do we make things in a very general sense, and how might we share the way we make things in a general sense the same way you share open source hardware? So, I'm thinking about, how can we generalize the way we make all sorts of things, so you end up with this sort of guy, right? And I think we have to sort of redefine and rethink how we define structure and materials and assembly things, so that we can really share the information on how you do those things in a more profound way and build on each other's source code for structure. Maybe I'm getting a little too abstract, but you know, this is the sort of -- returning to our comic characters -- this is sort of the universe, or a different universe view, that I think is going to be very prevalent in the future -- from biotech to materials assembly. I've probably got a couple of minutes of questions, or I can show -- I think they also said that I do extreme stuff in the introduction, so I may have to explain that.

68,"At the same time, a civil war was taking place in El Salvador, and again, the civilian population was caught up in the conflict. The Bosnian soldier who guided me told me that all of his friends were there now. I had to use it, channel its energy, turn it into something that would clarify my vision, instead of clouding it. It was a very old ritual that seemed symbolic of the political struggle that was changing the face of South Africa. American troops were sent to protect the relief shipments, but they were eventually drawn into the conflict, and after the tragic battle in Mogadishu, they were withdrawn. This man was in an NGO feeding center, being helped as much as he could be helped.

69,"We don't have that. So, this is what the planet's going to look like in 20 years. A lot of times, when I do a talk like this, I talk about things that everybody in this room I'm sure has already heard of, but most people haven't. One of the biggest levers that we have in the developed world for changing the impact that we have on the planet is changing the way that we live in cities. This is an example of bio-mimicry, which is something we're really starting to look a lot more for. But unfortunately, most of the people on the planet don't live in the cites we live in. So, we're adding a city the size of Seattle every seven days, and most of those cities look more like this than the city that you or I live in. And this is one of the things that we are looking for everywhere. We've heard all about this here this week, so I won't say too much more than that, other than to say what is true for cell phones is true for all sorts of technologies. And one of the things we're really, really interested in at Worldchanging is the ways in which the south is re-identifying itself, and re-categorizing itself in ways that have less and less to do with most of us in this room.

70,"What I'm going to do, in the spirit of collaborative creativity, is simply repeat many of the points that the three people before me have already made, but do them -- this is called ""creative collaboration;"" it's actually called ""borrowing"" -- but do it through a particular perspective, and that is to ask about the role of users and consumers in this emerging world of collaborative creativity that Jimmy and others have talked about. And then one of these companies that was importing parts for the clunkers decided to set up in business, start selling them to other people, and gradually another company emerged out of that, Marin, and it probably was, I don't know, 10, maybe even 15, years, before the big bike companies realized there was a market. It's when the Internet combines with these kinds of passionate pro-am consumers -- who are knowledgeable; they've got the incentive to innovate; they've got the tools; they want to -- that you get this kind of explosion of creative collaboration. So this is a huge challenge to the way we think creativity comes about. So the more radical the innovation, the more the uncertainty, the more you need innovation in use to work out what a technology is for. Do you go into your board and say, ""Look, I've got a fantastic idea for an embryonic product in a marginal market, with consumers we've never dealt with before, and I'm not sure it's going to have a big payoff, but it could be really, really big in the future?"" This is the phrase that I've used in some stuff which I've done with a think tank in London called Demos, where we've been looking at these people who are amateurs -- i.e., they do it for the love of it -- but they want to do it to very high standards. This is open; this is closed. This is new; this is traditional. Well, the first thing you can say, I think with certainty, is what Yochai has said already -- is there is a great big struggle between those two organizational forms. And so the debates about copyright, digital rights, so on and so forth -- these are all about trying to stifle, in my view, these kinds of organizations. But they don't want to be journalists. So here is one of the challenges, I think, for people like me, who do a lot of work with government. If you're a games company, and you've got a million players in your game, you only need one percent of them to be co-developers, contributing ideas, and you've got a development workforce of 10,000 people.

71,"This is actually quite meaningful to me, because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole -- we don't do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it -- and cars are thought so much as a product that it's a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side under the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art. And so cars, as art, brings it into an emotional plane -- if you accept that -- that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital A. And they put that same kind of tension into the sculpting of a car that you do in a great sculpture that you would go and look at in a museum. Why it means you have to wash a car, what is it, that sensuality you have to touch about it? That's what we're searching for -- when we're working our craft, we are really trying to find that truth out there. And first of all, you have to go with me for a second, and say, you know, you could take the word ""love"" out of a lot of things in our society, put the word ""design"" in, and it still works, like this quote here, you know. I think this one here, there's a pop song that really describes Philippe Starck for me, you know, this is like you know, this is like puppy love, you know, this is cool right? And this idea that there is more to love, more to design, when it gets down to your neighbor, your other, it can be physical like this, and maybe in the future it will be. So, what we did was: instead of having a staff of artists that are just your wrist, we decided to free up a team of creative designers and engineers to find out what's the successor to the SUV phenomenon in America. This is 1996 we did this project. You get a divergence of Newtonian and quantum thinking at that point, you have a split in your dialog that is so deep, and so far, that they cannot bring this together at all. And they hadn't done anything because -- kind of, like in car business, engineers are there to solve problems, and we were asking them to create a problem. And if you can imagine what this is like, to have these months of postcard indication of how great this team is working, and they're out there spending all this money, and they're learning, and they're doing all this stuff. I said, ""Guys, I'm thinking about something here, this isn't right. And I think we felt much closer that day, we cut a lot of strings that didn't need to be there, and we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about.","This is actually quite meaningful to me, because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole.

72,"I'm interested -- I kind of do the same thing, but I don't move my body. Because I have to say, for my whole career, if there's anything that's been consistent, it's been that you can't do it. And I've had for 30 years an interest in a series of complexities where a series of forces are brought to bear, and to understand the nature of the final result of that, representing the building itself. And I'd been extremely interested in this notion of randomness as it produces architectural work and as it definitely connects to the notion of the city, an accretional notion of the city, and that led to various ideas of organization. And what I'm interested in is not the styling of that, but the relationship of that as it enhances that activity. It became kind of an idea for the notion of the surface of a work, and it was used in a project where we could unravel that surface, and it was a figurative idea that was going to be folded and made into a very, kind of complex space. And the idea was the relationship of the space, which was made up of the fold of the image, and the dialectic or the conflict between the figuration, and the clarity of the image and the complexity of the space, which were in dialog. It has a material identity and it's translucent and it's porous, and it allows us for a very different notion of what a skin of a building is. And what we really want to do -- well, the architects, if there are architects out there, this is the Laugier Hut; this is the primitive hut that's been around for so long -- and what we wanted to do is really build this, because they see themselves as the caretakers of the world, and we wanted them to look down at their satellite, how they see their own site, that eight-acre site, and we wanted nothing left. And a project that was realized in Austria, the Hooper Bank, which again used this idea of connecting typology, the traditional buildings, and morphology, or the relationship of the development of land as an idea, into a complex, which is a piece of a city where we can see part of it is literally just this augmenting, this movement of the land that's a very simple idea of just lifting it up and occupying it, and other parts are much more energetic and intense. And talk about that intensity in terms of the collisions of the kind of events they make that have to do with putting a series of systems together, and then where part of it is in the ground, part of it is oppositional lifts. And then, again, in a more, kind of traditional setting, this is a graduate student housing in Toronto, and it's very much about the relationship of a building as it makes a connective tissue to the city. You could not proceed without making this negotiation between one's own values and the relationship of the character you're working with and how he understands the court, because I'm showing him, of course, Corbusier at Savoy, which is 1928, which is the beginning of modern architecture. And I'm a character that's extremely interested in understanding the nature of that constructed reality because there's no such thing as nature any more. And it forced us to talk about notions of how we work, and the dynamics of that, and what other sources of the work is.","I'm interested -- I kind of do the same thing, but I don't move my body.

73,"If we just look at the single, biggest cause of death -- aging -- it accounts for roughly two-thirds of all human people who die. Now, why do I say that this is a big problem? Well, let's first look at the probability -- and this is very, very difficult to estimate -- but there have been only four studies on this in recent years, which is surprising. You would think that it would be of some interest to try to find out more about this given that the stakes are so big, but it's a very neglected area. Now, if we think about what just reducing the probability of human extinction by just one percentage point -- not very much -- so that's equivalent to 60 million lives saved, if we just count the currently living people, the current generation. Is this the best we can do? And if we think about this, I think it's very clear that there are ways in which we could change things, not just by eliminating negatives, but adding positives. If we want to achieve this, what, in the world, would have to change? As far as I can see, all of you are users of this enhancement technology in this room, so that's a great thing. It's just better to be able to understand more of the world around you and the people that you are communicating with, and to remember what you have learned. It's also interesting to think about what other things are -- so if these all enabled great values, why should we think that evolution has happened to provide us with all the modalities we would need to engage with other values that there might be? And they would just stare at us with bafflement when we spend time listening to a beautiful performance, like the one we just heard -- because of people making stupid movements, and they would be really irritated and wouldn't see what we were up to. If you could actually choose to preserve your romantic attachments to one person, undiminished through time, so that wouldn't have to -- love would never have to fade if you didn't want it to. And then you can imagine some enhancements of human capacities. We have no reason to believe that within this much, much larger space there would not also be extremely worthwhile modes of being, perhaps ones that would be way beyond our wildest ability even to imagine or dream about.","Aging accounts for roughly two-thirds of all human people who die.

74,"And I think, a lot of times, what we do is just, sort of, hold the mirror up to our clients, and sort of go, ""Duh! We showed them the whole cut, and they were all completely, what is this? And the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day, all you do is look at the roof, and it's a really shitty experience. And so, that was a really catalytic thing for them. The first thing we did was we took a little bicycle mirror and we Band-Aided it here, onto a gurney, a hospital trolley, so that when you were wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor, you could actually have a conversation with them. And another idea, again, that came from one of the nurses -- which I love -- was they took traditional, sort of, corporate white boards, then they put them on one wall of the patient's room, and they put this sticker there.

75,"You should be really afraid that -- if we stick up the first slide on this thing -- there we go -- that you're missing out. And this is what this adventure's really about. (Laughter) It turns out that what this stuff is -- and Richard Dawkins has written about this -- is, this is really a river out of Eden. So, it's about the size of a little period on a sentence. Because each of us contains our entire gene code of where we've been for the past billion years, because we've evolved from that stuff, you can take that tree of life and collapse it back, and in the measure that you learn to reprogram, maybe we'll give birth to something that is very close to the first primordial ooze. In the measure that you have the source code, as all of you know, you can change the source code, and you can reprogram life forms so that this little thingy becomes a vaccine, or this little thingy starts producing biomaterials, which is why DuPont is now growing a form of polyester that feels like silk in corn. And what you can do now is, you can outlay exactly what your chromosome is, and what the gene code on that chromosome is right here, and what those genes code for, and what animals they code against, and then you can tie it to the literature. They look at the same world and they say... (Laughter) That's how the same gene code -- that's why you have 30,000 genes, mice have 30,000 genes, husbands have 30,000 genes.

He was 35. I was 23. So Wilkins said he thought it was the helix. So he didn't have it. And I read it, and it was just -- it was crap.

So the next day, you know, after I thought, ""Well, he might be right."" So, you know, if it didn't work this way, you might as well believe it, because you didn't have any other scheme. It was pretty obvious that it provided the information to an RNA molecule, and then how do you go from RNA to protein? (Laughter) And so I didn't really get happy until 1960, because then we found out, basically, you know, that there are three forms of RNA. It's not a -- it's only a partial look, but it's a -- I think it's going to be very, very useful.

82,"Imagine spending seven years at MIT and research laboratories, only to find out that you're a performance artist. (Laughter) I'm also a software engineer, and I make lots of different kinds of art with the computer. And I think the main thing that I'm interested in is trying to find a way of making the computer into a personal mode of expression. And many of you out there are the heads of Macromedia and Microsoft, and in a way those are my bane: I think there's a great homogenizing force that software imposes on people and limits the way they think about what's possible on the computer. Of course, it's also a great liberating force that makes possible, you know, publishing and so forth, and standards, and so on. But, in a way, the computer makes possible much more than what most people think, and my art has just been about trying to find a personal way of using the computer, and so I end up writing software to do that. Chris has asked me to do a short performance, and so I'm going to take just this time -- maybe 10 minutes -- to do that, and hopefully at the end have just a moment to show you a couple of my other projects in video form. (Applause) We've got about a minute left. I did a performance with two singers who specialize in making strange noises with their mouths. And this just came off last September at ARS Electronica; we repeated it in England. And the idea is to visualize their speech and song behind them with a large screen. And since we know where their heads are, and we have a wireless mic on them that we're processing the sound from, we're able to create visualizations which are linked very tightly to what they're doing with their speech. Well, suffice it to say it's not all like that, but that's part of it. I'm overtime, so I just wanted to say you can, if you're in New York, you can check out my work at the Whitney Biennial next week, and also at Bitforms Gallery in Chelsea.

83,"(Laughter) However, what I have to do as a musician is do everything that is not on the music; everything that there isn't time to learn from a teacher, or to talk about, even, from a teacher. However, that's just the initial idea I may have that we all get when we actually look and we try to interpret. Much more -- (Drum sound) and I just feel, at last, one with the stick and one with the drum. And so what we would do is that I would put my hands on the wall of the music room, and together, we would ""listen"" to the sounds of the instruments, and really try to connect with those sounds far, far more broadly than simply depending on the ear. And so therefore, I said to them, ""Well, look, if you refuse -- if you refuse me through those reasons, as opposed to the ability to perform and to understand and love the art of creating sound -- then we have to think very, very hard about the people you do actually accept."" The interesting thing about this as well, though -- (Applause) is quite simply that not only were people connected with sound -- which is basically all of us -- we well know that music really is our daily medicine. And of course, being the participator of the sound, and that is, starting from the idea of what type of sound I want to produce, for example, this sound: (No sound) Can you hear anything? So all of my performances are based on entirely what I experience, and not by learning a piece of music, putting on someone else's interpretation of it, buying all the CDs possible of that particular piece of music, and so on and so forth, because that isn't giving me enough of something that is so raw and so basic, and something that I can fully experience the journey of. So, because of this explosion in access to sound, especially through the Deaf community, this has not only affected how music institutions, how schools for the deaf treat sound, and not just as a means of therapy -- although, of course, being a participator of music, that definitely is the case as well -- but it's meant that acousticians have had to really think about the types of halls they put together. I cannot give you any detail as far as what is actually happening with those halls, but it's just the fact that they are going to a group of people for whom so many years, we've been saying, ""Well, how on earth can they experience music? No, I don't like that piece,"" and so on. It may be that the chemistry isn't quite right between myself and that particular piece of music, but that doesn't mean I have the right to say it's a bad piece of music. And you know, one of the great things about being a musician is that it is so unbelievably fluid. That's up to you, when you walk through a hall, because that then determines what and how we listen to certain things. The performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound, because they're hearing the contact of the stick -- (Drum sound) on the drum, or the mallet on the bit of wood, or the bow on the string, etc., or the breath that's creating the sound from wind and brass.","""What I have to do as a musician is do everything that is not on the music,"" he says.

85,"We're going to talk -- my -- a new lecture, just for TED -- and I'm going show you some illusions that we've created for TED, and I'm going to try to relate this to happiness. And it's in terms of both illusions and movies that we go see and jokes and magic shows is that there's something about these things where our expectations are violated in some sort of pleasing way. You look at those sort of illusions in my book and it's not as what you'd expect. So, what I'm going to try and do in my lecture is go a little bit further and see if I can violate your expectations in a pleasing way. I mean, sometimes expectations that are violated are not pleasant, but I'm going to try to do it in a pleasant way, in a very primal way, so I can make the audience here happy.

86,"But if I had one thing to say about this, before we get to first, it would be that from the time we started building this, the big idea wasn't the technology. We've solved all the transportation problems that have changed the world to get it to where we are today. Over the last hundred years, we started building cars, and then over the 50 years we've connected every city to every other city in an extraordinarily efficient way, and we have a very high standard of living as a consequence of that. If five percent of that population became, quote, middle class, and wanted to go the way we've gone in the last hundred years at the same time that 50 percent of their population are moving into cities of the size and density of Manhattan, every six weeks -- it isn't sustainable environmentally; it isn't sustainable economically -- there just ain't enough oil -- and it's not sustainable politically. But rather than go license this off, which is what we normally do, it seemed to me that if we put all our effort not into the technology, but into an understanding of a world that's solved all its other problems, but has somehow come to accept that cities -- which, right back from ancient Greece on, were meant to walk around, cities that were architected and built for people -- now have a footprint that, while we've solved every other transportation problem -- and it's like Moore's law. So you wonder, what if cities could give to their pedestrians what we take for granted as we now go between cities? What if it would make it a little bit more palatable to have access via this, as that last link to mass transit, to get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbs and use our cars the way we want, and then have our cities energized again? We thought it would be really neat to do that, and one of the problems we really were worried about is: how do we get legal on the sidewalk? Or maybe we should be out in the street in front of a Greyhound bus or a vehicle. But if I could ask you to do one thing, it's not to think about it as a piece of technology, but just imagine that, although we all understand somehow that it's reasonable that we use our 4,000-pound machine, which can go 60 miles an hour, that can bring you everywhere you want to go, and somehow it's also what we used for the last mile, and it's broken, and it doesn't work. A few weeks ago, after we launched it, we were here with a news crew on Venice Beach, zipping up and back, and he's marveling at the technology, and meanwhile bicycles are zipping by, and skateboarders are zipping by, and a little old lady -- I mean, if you looked in the dictionary, a little old lady -- came by me -- and now that I'm on this, I'm the height of a normal adult now -- and she just stops, and the camera is there, and she looks up at me and says, ""Can I try that?"" But she looks up and says this, and it occurs to me, well, kids aren't going to mind these things, and they don't vote, and business people and then young adults aren't going to mind these things -- they're pretty cool -- so I guess subliminally I was worried that it's the older population that's going to worry. (Applause) The bottom line is, whether you believe the United Nations, or any of the other think tanks -- in the next 20 years, all human population growth on this planet will be in cities. That's so much energy, you couldn't afford to desalinate or clean water in this country that way.

87,"(Laughter) So this is a mantis shrimp. And so what we did is, we took a look at these videos, and we measured how fast the limb was moving to get back to that original question. (Laughter) So, this -- what I saw, on every single mantis shrimp limb, whether it's a spearer or a smasher, is a beautiful saddle-shaped structure right on the top surface of the limb. And then we did a series of calculations, and what we were able to show is that these mantis shrimp have to have a spring. So we thought, OK, this must be a spring -- the saddle could very well be a spring. And then if you take a look at the video -- it's a little bit hard to see -- it's outlined in yellow. And this is very well known to engineers and architects, because it's a very strong surface in compression. And so all I had to do was actually put a little shrimp paste on the front of the load cell, and they'd smash away at it. And so this is just a regular video of the animal just smashing the heck out of this load cell. Sheila Patek: And so if we just take that one frame, what you can actually see there at the end of that yellow arrow is a vapor bubble. And what that is, is cavitation. So this is a potent force in fluid systems, and just to sort of take it one step further, I'm going to show you the mantis shrimp approaching the snail. So to solve this quandary of the two force peaks: what I think was going on is: that first impact is actually the limb hitting the load cell, and the second impact is actually the collapse of the cavitation bubble. (Laughter) So, the saddles -- that saddle-shaped spring -- has actually been well known to biologists for a long time, not as a spring but as a visual signal. And what they do is, up until that time period when they can't strike, they become really obnoxious and awful, and they strike everything in sight; it doesn't matter who or what.","Sheila Patek: On every single mantis shrimp limb, whether it's a spearer or a smasher, is a beautiful saddle-shaped structure right on the top surface of the limb.

Now this is typically how you see sunfish, this is where they get their common name. So I was just intrigued with what -- you know, what is this animal's story? Now I don't know how you'd feed a child like that but -- we don't know how fast the Molas grow in the wild, but captive growth studies at the Monterey Bay Aquarium -- one of the first places to have them in captivity -- they had one that gained 800 lbs in 14 months. How do you do that with an animal -- very few places in the world. And it can record this data for up to two years, and keep it in that tag, release at a pre-programmed time, float to the surface, upload all that data, that whole travelogue, to satellite, which relays it directly to our computers, and we've got that whole dataset. So the great thing about the Mola is that when we put the tag on them -- if you look up here -- that's streaming off, that's right where we put the tag. And we'd love to tag here -- this is an aerial shot of Monterey -- but unfortunately, the Molas here end up looking like this because another one of our locals really likes Molas but in the wrong way. And I'm not exaggerating, it is just -- and sometimes they don't eat them, it's just spiteful. And it's also a great place to go down south because the water's warmer, and the Molas are kind of friendly down there. Well, not the one we tagged! This is their track: we deployed the tag off of Tokyo, and the Mola in one month kind of got into the Kuroshio Current off of Japan and foraged there. And this is a day in the life of a Mola, and if we -- they're up and down, and up and down, and up and down, and up and up and down, up to 40 times a day.

91,"But, you know, we've just come from this discussion of what a bird might be. What is a bird? This is a bird. Someone heard the six hours of talk that I gave called ""The Monticello Dialogues"" on NPR, and sent me this as a thank you note -- ""We realize that design is a signal of intention, but it also has to occur within a world, and we have to understand that world in order to imbue our designs with inherent intelligence, and so as we look back at the basic state of affairs in which we design, we, in a way, need to go to the primordial condition to understand the operating system and the frame conditions of a planet, and I think the exciting part of that is the good news that's there, because the news is the news of abundance, and not the news of limits, and I think as our culture tortures itself now with tyrannies and concerns over limits and fear, we can add this other dimension of abundance that is coherent, driven by the sun, and start to imagine what that would be like to share.""

And so this is the existing city, and this is the new city.","Someone heard the six hours of talk that I gave called ""The Monticello Dialogues"" on NPR.

92,"So this is some of the challenge that we have here, is you can see that it's actually kind of hard to get the -- there we go. Now what I would like to do is just to show you what one second of this activity would look like. You can see that it got started right here. In fact, many of the organizations that are here -- the Acumen Fund, I think ApproTEC we have running, I'm not sure if that one's up yet -- and many of the people who have presented here are running through Google Grants. And Sergey mentioned Orkut, which is something that, you know, Orkut wanted to do in his time, and we call this -- at Google, we've embodied this as ""the 20 percent time,"" and the idea is, for 20 percent of your time, if you're working at Google, you can do what you think is the best thing to do. And I think many other things in the world also have come out of this. So it'd be like three people, or something like that, and they would try to make a product. You know, the Googlettes -- that's a small project that we're not quite sure if it's going to work or not, but we hope it will, and if we do enough of them, some of them will really work and turn out, such as News. And this was kind of a surprise to me, but we found that as long as you keep the 100 things in your head, which you did by writing them down, that you could do a pretty good job deciding what to do and where to put your resources. This is another example of a project that somebody at Google was really passionate about, and they just, they got going, and it's really, really a great product, and really taking off. Google Answers is something we started, which is really cool, which lets you -- for five to 100 dollars, you can type a question in, and then there's a pool of researchers that go out and research it for you, and it's guaranteed and all that, and you can get actually very good answers to things without spending all that time yourself. But all of these -- well, these were all sort of innovative things that we did that -- you know, we try many, many different things in our company. And we didn't like that, so we actually, in maybe a couple of weeks, we built these little enclosures that enclosed the projectors, and so we can leave them on all the time and they're completely silent. And so we'd say, you know, ""Did you mean 'search for'"" -- what is this, in this case, ""Saddam Hussein,"" because this blog is about Iraq -- and you know, in addition to the ads, and we thought this would be a great idea. I wanted to end just by saying that there's a couple things that really make me excited to be involved with Google, and one of those is that we're able to make money largely through advertising, and one of the benefits that I didn't expect from that was that we're able to serve everyone in the world without worrying about, you know, places that don't have as much money.","At Google, we've embodied this as ""the 20 percent time,"" and the idea is, for 20 percent of your time, if you're working at Google, you can do what you think is the best thing to do.

95,"Now of course, we know that he didn't really mean that, but in this country at the moment, you can't be too careful. If you want to know what I have to say about Darwinism itself, I'm afraid you're going to have to look at my books, which you won't find in the bookstore outside. There is an effective evolution lobby coordinating the fight on behalf of science, and I try to do all I can to help them, but they get quite upset when people like me dare to mention that we happen to be atheists as well as evolutionists. What it means is: here is an idea or a notion that you're not allowed to say anything bad about. Because you're not."" As has been said before, we are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in. Darwin said, ""I have never been an atheist in the same sense of denying the existence of a God. Darwin thought that atheism might be well and good for the intelligentsia, but that ordinary people were not, quote, ""ripe for it."" Like God. You would strictly have to be agnostic about whether there is a teapot in orbit about Mars, but that doesn't mean you treat the likelihood of its existence as on all fours with its non-existence. If you want to believe one particular one of them -- unicorns or tooth fairies or teapots or Yahweh -- the onus is on you to say why. And this is why my friend uses ""tooth-fairy agnostic"" as a label for what most people would call atheist. Now, I said that if I were religious, I'd be very afraid of evolution -- I'd go further: I would fear science in general, if properly understood. Now, this is an elite audience, and I would therefore expect about 10 percent of you to be religious. (Laughter) If you're one of them, and of course many of you may not be, but if you are one of them, I'm asking you to stop being polite, come out, and say so.","Darwin thought that atheism might be well and good for the intelligentsia, but that ordinary people were not, quote, ""ripe for it.""

96,"This year -- maybe you could show the slides -- this year we're carrying this Treo, which we had a lot to do with and helped Handspring design it. But something's happened in the last 18 years since Richard started TED, and that's that people like us -- I know people in other places have caught onto this for a long time, but for us, we've really just started ... we've kind of climbed Maslow's hierarchy a little bit -- and so we're now focused more and more on human-centered design, human-centeredness in an approach to design. I have a few of them -- they're no more than a minute or a minute-and-a-half apiece -- but I thought you might be interested in seeing some of our work over the last year, and how it responds in video. We can put that up on a touch screen and you can play with that, and get more information about the clothing that you're interested in as you're trying it on. So you can see what you look like from the back or all the way around, as you look. And so you can see that the goal is to bring some of the feedback that the people who had gone to the museum were giving, and get it up on the wall so everybody could see. And then when you get to a station, it's expanded so that you can actually read it. So we thought, well, wouldn't it be fun to get together with some of the smartest design guys in the world and try to figure out if we could make the cubicle better? So you feel that in your cubicle. DK: And of course: a hammock for your afternoon nap that stretches across your cubicle. So you can get the information on the front side, but as they rotate, you can see the actual recycling plant behind, with all the machines as they actually process the water. You can see: there's the plant. (Applause) DK: And the last thing I'll talk about is ApproTEC, which is a project that I'm very excited about. We also were thinking about the experience of Richard, and so -- (Laughter) -- we designed this hat, because I knew I'd be the last one in the day and I needed to deal with him. And in my own practice, from product to ApproTEC, it's really exciting that we're taking a more human-centered approach to design, that we're including behaviors and personalities in the things we do, and I think this is great.","This year -- maybe you could show the slides -- this year we're carrying this Treo, which we had a lot to do with and helped Handspring design it.

97,"Basically, there's a major demographic event going on. And it may be that passing the 50 percent urban point is an economic tipping point. So the world now is a map of connectivity. What we have now is the end of the rise of the West. That's over. So what's really going on? Well, villages of the world are emptying out. The question is, why?

98,"So what I'm going to talk about is why we don't have a good brain theory, why it is important that we should develop one and what we can do about it. (Laughter) So what happened was, when I was young and got out of engineering school at Cornell in '79, I went to work for Intel and was in the computer industry, and three months into that, I fell in love with something else. I said, look: We have all this knowledge about brains -- how hard can it be? But I'm doing it now, and I'm going to tell you about it. So why don't we have a good theory of brains? This is a symptom of the fact that we just don't have a theory. So we can say, my neocortex, the part of the brain I'm interested in, has 30 billion cells. But, you know what? So, you know, I don't think there's anything to that. You do. And all the time you say, ""Oh, I can predict things,"" so if you're a rat and you go through a maze, and you learn the maze, next time you're in one, you have the same behavior. I don't have time to explain, but to understand how a brain works, you have to understand how the first part of the mammalian neocortex works, how it is we store patterns and make predictions. First of all, we have to have the right framework. If you don't build it, you don't understand it. And if you talk to them, they knew what they were doing was really significant, but they didn't really know what was going to happen.","""We have all this knowledge about brains -- how hard can it be?

If you want to see the features of this car, you can see it here. And this one I really won't spend any time on, except to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well. One of them is Seadragon and the other is some very beautiful computer-vision research done by Noah Snavely, a graduate student at the University of Washington, co-advised by Steve Seitz at U.W. And so this is live on the Web. Some are much more spatial. I would like to jump straight to one of Noah's original data-sets -- this is from an early prototype that we first got working this summer -- to show you what I think is really the punch line behind the Photosynth technology, It's not necessarily so apparent from looking at the environments we've put up on the website. And so these are all Flickr images, and they've all been related spatially in this way. We can just navigate in this very simple way.

And of course, a by-product of all of that is immensely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth, collected not just from overhead flights and from satellite images and so on, but from the collective memory.

101,"I think that, if we look at what happened on the Internet, with such an incredible last half a dozen years, that it's hard to even get the right analogy for it. And so I think the tempting analogy for the boom-bust that we just went through with the Internet is a gold rush. But you had the same thing with the Gold Rush. In fact it was so bad that most of the horses died before they could get where they were going. And, but it really -- it got the electricity. But that is not the -- and that's not the part that's really most similar to the Web. So all of the cabling and all of the heavy infrastructure -- I'm going back now to, sort of, the explosive part of the Web in 1994, when it was growing 2,300 percent a year. And this was huge.

103,"We tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important; we'll typically do it twice. And these are the inflection points that tell you what the next chapter in that technology's life is going to be, and maybe how you can do something about it. Each one of those is an opportunity to do something about it; it's an opportunity for the technology to change. I'd like to demonstrate what I mean by this by telling the story of the DVD, which is a technology which has done all of these. The DVD, as you know, was introduced in the mid-1990s and it was quite expensive. The next thing it hit, a year later, was critical mass. I'd like to talk about some other technologies out there, just technologies on our radar -- and I'll use this lens, these four, as a way to kind of tell you where each one of those technologies is in its development. They're not necessarily the top-10 technologies out there -- they're just examples of technologies that are in each one of these periods. Here's another technology that's approaching a critical price. And the falling price of drugs has a lot to do with that. If you look here, here's Linux in red, and it's hit 20 percent. And if you look at the trends here, by about 2008 -- and I don't think this is a crazy forecast -- they'll be two percent of auto sales. And once you have electric motors, you can do anything: you can change the structure of the car in any way you want. And what's interesting is that it was just 1990 when it was more than two dollars a minute. And I think that's probably one of the most important technology trends that we're looking at today.","The DVD, as you know, was introduced in the mid-1990s and it was quite expensive.

104,"And if there is one tremendous -- if there is one great catastrophe about the places that we've built, the human environments we've made for ourselves in the last 50 years, it is that it has deprived us of the ability to live in a hopeful present. These will be places that are not worth caring about. When we have enough of them, we're going to have a nation that's not worth defending. You know, in these places in other cultures, people just go there voluntarily because they like them. We don't have to have a craft fair here to get people to come here. (Laughter) You know, you don't have to have a Kwanzaa festival. It wasn't Pei and Cobb, another firm designed this, but there's not enough Prozac in the world to make people feel OK about going down this block. And what is the message that is coming, what are the vocabularies and grammars that are coming, from this building and how is it informing us about who we are? And that's it. And we're not going to cure the problems of the urban by dragging the country into the city, which is what a lot of us are trying to do all the time.

So we said, what is -- KA: It was not an inclusive group? And the city actually -- through Tim Zagat initially, and then through Christyne Nicholas, then we got to Giuliani -- said, ""You know we don't want to do anything with Pier 94 right now, but we have an observation platform for the families down at Ground Zero that we'd like to be a more dignified experience for the families, and a way to protect it from the weather."" And I remembered on September 11th, on 14th Street, the roof of our building -- we can see the World Trade Towers prominently -- and I saw the first building collapse from a conference room on the eighth floor on a TV that we had set up. So we went back to the city and said we're not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a VIP platform, but we've spent some time down there. And we also, frankly, knew that if it didn't happen by the end of the Giuliani administration, then everyone who we were dealing with at the DOT and the Police Department and all of the -- we were meeting with 20 or 30 people with the city at a time, and it was set up by the Office of Emergency Management. So the first thing we had to do was find a way to get this -- we had to work with the families of the victims, through the city, to make sure that they knew this was happening. And I think this was the 21st, and we knew this had to be built and up by the 28th. There was no sense of the fact that this is next to Saint Paul -- that this is really a place that needs to be kind of dignified, and a place to reflect and remember. And I think people were amazed at two things -- I think they were amazed at the destruction, but I think there was a sense of disbelief about the heroics of New Yorkers that I found very moving. DR: Well here's the issue: we knew that this was not in the sense of -- we think about the site, and think about the need for a memorial. DR: No, I don't think so. What's interesting now is the nature of the site has totally changed, so that what you're aware of is not just the destruction of the buildings in Ground Zero, but all of the buildings around it -- and the scars on the building around it, which are enormous.

108,"So what that meant was, when I went down to Fort Dix, I had to hop out in front of 180 guys and tell them of my vision. Soldiers: IV! SP: You don't put 150,000 troops in there, and say we're there to create democracy. There they are! And you know, Paul was talking, and he then turned to Constance and said, ""You know, I wouldn't have this conversation if she weren't here, because I know she has my back."" So, I wanted to say, Paul, I'm happy you're here, because I know you have my back. So I wanted to show you a clip, and then I was going tell you a little bit of how it got put together. So you get to experience that in real time, right? Now, the news footage I put in there to try to show -- you know, I think mainstream media tries to do the best they can in the format that they have. But the thing that I know you all have heard a lot of times, American soldiers saying, ""Why don't they talk about the good stuff that we do?"" And we have to be able to go into scary places where we may, you know, we think we know. And for me, one of the most profound stories someone shared with me, that then became my story, was -- for those of you who haven't seen the film, and it's not a spoiler -- it's very common there are a lot of civilian accidents, where people get in front of Humvees and they get killed. So when I talk about a disconnect, it's not only for maybe those people who don't know a soldier, which there obviously are. You can go for days here and not feel like there's a war going on.

Which it isn't really, is it? What we know about how to be who we are comes from stories. If you want to know about Africa, read our literature -- and not just ""Things Fall Apart,"" because that would be like saying, ""I've read 'Gone with the Wind' and so I know everything about America."" So, you know, the thing is to remember that because otherwise, 10 years from now, we'll be back here trying to tell this story again. So, what it says to me then is that it's not really -- the problem isn't really the stories that are being told or which stories are being told, the problem really is the terms of humanity that we're willing to bring to complicate every story, and that's really what it's all about.

111,"But this is about Africa, the story we have not heard. A part of my talk is going to be about investment opportunities that exist on this continent, to separate the rhetoric from the reality, the fact from the fiction. To go to the actual data and statistics that exist about the actual things that are happening on the ground that make Africa a realistic investment opportunity and option for you. The lesson from that was that it was Africa -- an African story -- that was used to share news with the rest of the world of what the benchmark can be for corporate turnarounds. And the Siwa Oasis is famous for several things, but the key thing is that it was the place that Alexander the Great went to when he wanted to find out what his destiny had in store for him. With no natural light source, Siva is one of these amazing places that when you look up you see a perfect tapestry. And while Africa may be dark, the thing that brought the message home to me was that this is the challenge we are facing, but it's also the opportunity. Because whilst Africa may be dark -- other than the few specks that exist north and in the south and other areas -- it's aglow with the light in the hearts of the millions of people that are there. More fascinating, you have other countries -- South Africa, Mauritius, Namibia -- all in single digits. And the first myth to dispel is that Africa is not a country.

112,"We all have come from a long way, here in Africa, and converged in this region of Africa, which is a place where 90 percent of our evolutionary process took place. And I say that not because I am African, but it's in Africa that you find the earliest evidence for human ancestors, upright walking traces, even the first technologies in the form of stone tools. Because it's only when you do that, that you can talk about -- (Laughter) -- it's only when you do that, [that] you can talk about how we looked like and how we behaved at different times, and how those likes and looks and behaviors changed through time. (Laughter) And you find nothing for years and years. Of course, they cannot, but I'm telling you already that the environment and the carrying capacity of this region was drastically different from what we have today. They would find a bone and tell me, ""Here is what you're looking for."" In a way, this was like the second birth for the child, after 3.3 million years, but the labor was very long. But to do that, you need the permanent dentition, which you don't see here, because what you have here are the baby teeth. And to know how old she was when she died, what you do is you do an informed estimate, and you say, how much time would be required to form this amount of teeth, and the answer was three. So, with all that information, the big question is -- what do we actually -- what does she tell us? What do we actually know about our ancestors? It's a bone which is right here. It was not known in the fossil record, and we have it in this skeleton. Of course, in addition to extracting this huge amount of scientific information as to what makes us human, you know, the many human ancestors that have existed over the past six million years -- and there are more than 10 -- they did not have the knowledge, the technology and sophistications that we, Homo sapiens, have today. So finally, I would like to say, so let's help Africa walk upright and forward, then we all can be proud of our future legacy as a species.","We all have come from a long way, here in Africa, and converged in this region of Africa, which is a place where 90 percent of our evolutionary process took place.

114,"Think African governments will put together a conference like this? The Cheetah Generation is a new breed of Africans who brook no nonsense about corruption. They're not going to wait for government to do things for them. Did you know that 40 percent of the wealth created in Africa is not invested here in Africa? There is the people, and then there is the government or leaders. The second false premise that we make when we're trying to help Africa is that sometimes we think that there is something called a government in Africa that cares about its people, serves the interests of the people, and represents the people. The third fundamental issue that we have to recognize is that if we want to help the African people, we must know where the African people are. Now the modern sector, of course, is where a lot of the development aid and resources went into. The other sectors, the informal and the traditional sectors, are where you find the majority of the African people, the real people in Africa. But that's not what we did. Now, this is what I have described to you. They don't take any orders from their chiefs. So, in a nutshell, what we had in traditional Africa was a free-market system.

The old fogeys don't come because they're mad at Buddha, because when he came to their city he accepted -- he always accepts the first invitation that comes to him, from whoever it is, and the local geisha, a movie-star sort of person, raced the elders of the city in a chariot and invited him first. And then Leilei -- I know his other name -- told us about interconnection, and how we're all totally interconnected here, and how we've all known each other.

And therefore it will become intolerable -- what compassion is, is where it will become intolerable for us, totally intolerable that we sit here in comfort and in pleasure and enjoying the life of the mind or whatever it is, and there are people who are absolutely riddled with disease and they cannot have a bite of food and they have no place, or they're being brutalized by some terrible person and so forth.

This gadget you see right here was called the digital wall mapper, and it produced the first three-dimensional map anybody has ever done of a cave, and it happened to be underwater in Wakulla Springs. Now we have to get through the ice. And as the movie says, this is one smart puppy. This is part of DEPTHX's mission. There are more stages involved here than I've got time to tell you about, but basically we drive through the space, we populate it with environmental variables -- sulphide, halide, things like that. The next thing we need are places to stay on orbit. It's not going to look like that. And the first thing is everything you do in space you pay by the kilogram. There is a place where you can. In fact, you can get it better -- you can get it at 14 times lower if you can find propellant on the moon. We can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics. And we can extend that now to just about everything. The traditional approach to space exploration has been that you carry all the fuel you need to get everybody back in case of an emergency.

120,"I've been watching, since I grew up, the expressions of truth and beauty in the arts and truth and beauty in the sciences. And while these are both wonderful things in their own right -- they both have very wonderful things going for them -- truth and beauty as ideals that can be looked at by the sciences and by math are almost like the ideal conjoined twins that a scientist would want to date. (Laughter) These are expressions of truth as awe-full things, by meaning they are things you can worship. They are ideals that are powerful. Truth and beauty are things that are often opaque to people who are not in the sciences. If you look at the math, E=mc squared, if you look at the cosmological constant, where there's an anthropic ideal, where you see that life had to evolve from the numbers that describe the universe -- these are things that are really difficult to understand. And what I've tried to do since I had my training as a medical illustrator -- since I was taught animation by my father, who was a sculptor and my visual mentor -- I wanted to figure out a way to help people understand truth and beauty in the biological sciences by using animation, by using pictures, by telling stories so that the things that are not necessarily evident to people can be brought forth, and can be taught, and can be understood. Students today are often immersed in an environment where what they learn is subjects that have truth and beauty embedded in them, but the way they're taught is compartmentalized and it's drawn down to the point where the truth and beauty are not always evident. And these micro-machines power how a cell moves. And so what we wanted to do was to figure out how we could make this story into an animation that would be the centerpiece of BioVisions at Harvard, which is a website that Harvard has for its molecular and cellular biology students that will -- in addition to all the textual information, in addition to all the didactic stuff -- put everything together visually, so that these students would have an internalized view of what a cell really is in all of its truth and beauty, and be able to study with this view in mind, so that their imaginations would be sparked, so that their passions would be sparked and so that they would be able to go on and use these visions in their head to make new discoveries and to be able to find out, really, how life works. And figure out how to do this in a way that was truthful in that it imparted what was going on, but not so truthful that the compact crowding in a cell would prevent the vista from happening. But these machines that power the inside of the cells are really quite amazing, and they really are the basis of all life because all of these machines interact with each other. (Laughter) So what I want you to do when you go home is think about this, and think about how powerful our cells are. Once we figure out all that's going on -- and believe me, we know almost a percent of what's going on -- once we figure out what's going on, we're really going to be able to have a lot of control over what we do with our health, with what we do with future generations, and how long we're going to live. (Music) But it's really quite amazing that these cells, these micro-machines, are aware enough of what the cell needs that they do their bidding.","I've been watching, since I grew up, the expressions of truth and beauty in the arts.

122,"In 2004, I started Participant Productions and we had a really good first year, and no call. And when we heard a lot of the presentations over the last couple of days, Ed Wilson and the pictures of James Nachtwey, I think we all realized how far we have to go to get to this new version of humanity that I like to call ""Humanity 2.0.""

124,"An average African country receives foreign aid to the tune of 13, 15 percent of its GDP, and that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources from rich countries to poor countries. But I want to say that there are two things we need to connect. What should we do with it? We should deliver medicines to those who are ill. We should send peacekeeping troops to serve those who are facing a civil war. Ladies and gentlemen, can any one of you tell me a neighbor, a friend, a relative that you know, who became rich by receiving charity? My own country, Uganda, has a quota to export 50,000 metric tons of sugar to the European Union market. So, I want to argue today that the fundamental source of Africa's inability to engage the rest of the world in a more productive relationship is because it has a poor institutional and policy framework. And because many of our governments are quite dictatorial, they need really to have the army clobber the opposition. Why should people support their government? But I want to put a caveat on my argument, and that caveat is that it is not true that aid is always destructive. Aid increases the resources available to governments, and that makes working in a government the most profitable thing you can have, as a person in Africa seeking a career. I also want to say that it is important for us to note that, over the last 50 years, Africa has been receiving increasing aid from the international community, in the form of technical assistance, and financial aid, and all other forms of aid. Between 1960 and 2003, our continent received 600 billion dollars of aid, and we are still told that there is a lot of poverty in Africa. I want to use the example of my own country, called Uganda, and the kind of structure of incentives that aid has brought there. Why does the government of Uganda budget spend 110 percent of its own revenue?","An average African country receives foreign aid to the tune of 13, 15 percent of its GDP.

125,"A transitive verb mandates that there has to be an object there: ""Sam devoured the pizza."" You can't just say, ""Sam devoured."" For example, the dative construction in English. This would be an example of how to do that. So which verbs go in which construction -- the problem with which I began -- depends on whether the verb specifies a kind of motion or a kind of possession change. You can think of this as the language of thought, or ""mentalese."" It seems to be based on a fixed set of concepts, which govern dozens of constructions and thousands of verbs -- not only in English, but in all other languages -- fundamental concepts such as space, time, causation and human intention, such as, what is the means and what is the ends? You can also say, ""Biff went from sick to well."" Second conclusion is that the ability to conceive of a given event in two different ways, such as ""cause something to go to someone"" and ""causing someone to have something,"" I think is a fundamental feature of human thought, and it's the basis for much human argumentation, in which people don't differ so much on the facts as on how they ought to be construed. And I think the biggest picture of all would take seriously the fact that so much of our verbiage about abstract events is based on a concrete metaphor and see human intelligence itself as consisting of a repertoire of concepts -- such as objects, space, time, causation and intention -- which are useful in a social, knowledge-intensive species, whose evolution you can well imagine, and a process of metaphorical abstraction that allows us to bleach these concepts of their original conceptual content -- space, time and force -- and apply them to new abstract domains, therefore allowing a species that evolved to deal with rocks and tools and animals, to conceptualize mathematics, physics, law and other abstract domains. Well, I said I'd talk about two windows on human nature -- the cognitive machinery with which we conceptualize the world, and now I'm going to say a few words about the relationship types that govern human social interaction, again, as reflected in language. For example, in polite requests, if someone says, ""If you could pass the guacamole, that would be awesome,"" we know exactly what he means, even though that's a rather bizarre concept being expressed. You want to express the bribe, the command, the promise, the solicitation and so on, but you also have to negotiate and maintain the kind of relationship you have with the other person. One way of thinking about it is to imagine what it would be like if language -- where it could only be used literally. On the other hand, with indirect language, if you issue a veiled bribe, then the dishonest officer could interpret it as a bribe, in which case you get the payoff of going free.","A transitive verb mandates that there has to be an object there: ""Sam devoured the pizza"" You can also say, ""Biff went from sick to well"" The ability to conceive of a given event in two different ways is a fundamental feature of human thought. sis for much human argumentation, in which people don't differ so much on the facts as on how they ought to be construed.

128,"I don't think we're going to make it. And so, what I'd like to do now is to tell you about what we've learned in those journeys. And so, I want to tell you about what we've learned in doing that and four lessons I've learned in the last year. This is a story about how Wal-Mart went green, and what that means. They committed that they're going to take their existing stores and reduce their energy consumption by 20 percent, and their new stores by 30 percent, and do all that in seven years. Well, Bob said the most important thing we could do right now is to make it clear in Sacramento, California that we need a market-based system of mandates that's going to cap and reduce greenhouse gases in California. And the result of that is, we're going to generate 83,000 new jobs, four billion dollars a year in annual income, and reduce the CO2 emissions by 174 million tons a year. It's a great start, but I've got to tell you -- where I started -- I'm really afraid. In fact, I'm afraid all of the best policies we have are not going to be enough. Third fact: I bet you didn't know that there's enough energy in hot rocks under the country to supply America's energy needs for the next thousand years. And who would have thought that all that is not enough? Now, we may have the political will to do this in the U.S., but I've got to tell you, we've got only one atmosphere, and so somehow we're going to have to find the political will to do this all around the world. Now, here's the hard question, if the trajectory of all the world's companies and individuals and policies and innovation is not going to be enough, what are we going to do? What can you do?

129,"(Laughter) What I want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories and talk about a different Africa. While it is true that those things are going on, there's an Africa that you don't hear about very much. And therefore, when you hear about the corrupt Africa -- corruption all the time -- I want you to know that the people and the governments are trying hard to fight this in some of the countries, and that some successes are emerging. But let me say this: if Alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in London -- if the other people who had taken money, estimated at 20 to 40 billion now of developing countries' monies sitting abroad in the developed countries -- if they're able to do this, what is that? And what is happening in many African countries now is a realization that no one can do it but us. We have to do it. And this is what we started to do in one of the largest countries on the continent, Nigeria. In fact, if you're not in Nigeria, you're not in Africa. No one can do it for you. But there's a huge market out there, and people don't know about it, or they don't want to know. And what is more important, because we want to get away from oil and diversify -- and there are so many opportunities in this one big country, as in many countries in Africa -- what was remarkable is that much of this growth came not from the oil sector alone, but from non-oil. And I can go on. But you should know that this continent is not -- is a continent of many countries, not one country. And I want to say that some of the best people to invest in on the continent are the women. When you go to Tanzania, listen carefully, because I'm sure you will hear of the various openings that there will be for you to get involved in something that will do good for the continent, for the people and for yourselves.","There's an Africa that you don't hear about very much, President Obama says.

130,"If you follow policy, you probably know that a few years ago the president pledged 15 billion dollars to fight the epidemic over five years, and a lot of that money is going to go to programs that try to replicate Uganda and use behavior change to encourage people and decrease the epidemic. So today I'm going to talk about some things that you might not know about the epidemic, and I'm actually also going to challenge some of these things that you think that you do know. I think it may seem like I'm ignoring the policy stuff, which is really the most important, but I'm hoping that at the end of this talk you will conclude that we actually cannot develop effective policy unless we really understand how the epidemic works. So this means that in a place with a lot of AIDS, there's a really significant cost of sex. But I'm going to argue that you shouldn't be surprised by this, and that to understand this you need to think about health the way than an economist does -- as an investment. And the way that I'm going to do that is, I'm going to look across areas with different levels of malaria. So one way to test to see whether we can explain some of this behavior change by differences in life expectancy is to look and see is there more behavior change in areas where there's less malaria. Then if you poked a little more, you looked a little more at what was going on, you'd find that actually that was a pretty good year, because in some years the only people tested are IV drug users. And I think that the answer is, we can look at mortality data, and we can use mortality data to figure out what the prevalence was in the past. To do this, we're going to have to rely on the fact that AIDS is a very specific kind of disease. I'm going to talk a little bit in a minute about how we can use this kind of information to learn something that's going to help us think about the world. But it also tells us something about one of these things that we think that we know. So if you combine the intuition in this figure with some of the data that I talked about before, it suggests that somewhere between 25 percent and 50 percent of the decline in prevalence in Uganda actually would have happened even without any education campaign. And if it was only 50 percent as effective as we think that it was, then there are all sorts of other things maybe we should be spending our money on instead. There are more things that I think that I want to do.","The president pledged 15 billion dollars to fight the epidemic over five years.

131,"I said, ""Look, we get rid of the charity side, and we run this as a business and I'll help you."" First of all, I thought, well, we need a sales team, and we clearly aren't the A-Team here, so let's -- I did all this training. And the women said, ""It really is."" And I said, ""What?"" And -- (Laughter) -- I learned then that listening isn't just about patience, but that when you've lived on charity and dependent your whole life long, it's really hard to say what you mean. And, mostly because people never really ask you, and when they do, you don't really think they want to know the truth. I think the market can help us figure that out, but there's got to be a charitable component, or I don't think we're going to create the kind of societies we want to live in. Both of them are in Africa. Both of them live at the confluence of public health and enterprise, and both of them, because they're manufacturers, create jobs directly, and create incomes indirectly, because they're in the malaria sector, and Africa loses about 13 billion dollars a year because of malaria. I talked about it a little at Oxford two years ago, and some of you visited A to Z manufacturing, which is one of the great, real companies in East Africa. And so, Anuj and Acumen have been talking about testing the private sector, because the assumption that the aid establishment has made is that, look, in a country like Tanzania, 80 percent of the population makes less than two dollars a day. And so we came in with a second round of patient capital to A to Z, a loan as well as a grant, so that A to Z could play with pricing and listen to the marketplace, and found a number of things. And when you listen to them, they'll also have a lot to say about what they like and what they don't like.

Today, with diabetes, what do we do? And it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it, but if it worked, we would truly be able to do something different. So today's reality is that if we get sick, the message is we will treat your symptoms, and you need to adjust to a new way of life. How can we do that? It's a natural process, but it is lost as we age. There are materials that do this. And what I'm going to show you here is stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient.

At this point, we've left the water, and now with this little creature -- we could bring up the volume a little bit -- and now we might try to eat. And this is where the game starts getting interesting, because one of the things we really focused on here was giving the players very high-leverage tools, so that for very little effort, the player can make something very cool.

And in the measure that we plant stuff, what we learn from agriculture is you've got to deal with pests, you've got to deal with all types of awful things, you've got to cultivate stuff. And as you do that stuff, here's what happens to productivity. One of the ironies of this whole system is we're discussing what to do about a system that we don't understand.

That is what bioenergy is. What is this? And as you think about this stuff and what the implications of this are, we're going to start not just converting ethanol from corn with very high subsidies. Now, if you can take part of the energy content out of doing this, you reduce the system, and you really do start applying biological principles to energy. This has to be a bridge to the point where you can get to wind, to the point where you can get to solar, to the point where you can get to nuclear -- and hopefully you won't build the next nuclear plant on a beautiful seashore next to an earthquake fault. And be that oil, be that gas, be that coal, this is what we're dealing with. And as we think of this bridge to the future, one of the things you should ponder is: we are leaving about two-thirds of the oil today inside those wells. One of the things that we've got to do is to stabilize oil prices. Well, let's put a tax on oil that is a non-revenue tax, and it basically says for the next 20 years, the price of oil will be -- whatever you want, 35 bucks, 40 bucks.","Biological principles can be applied to energy production, says Richard Branson.

My view is that if you want to involve yourself in the life of people who have been given up on, you have to look like the solution and not the problem. And I happen to know that company pretty well because John Heinz, who was our U.S. senator -- who was tragically killed in a plane accident -- he had heard about my desire to build a new building, because I had a cardboard box and I put it in a garbage bag and I walking all over Pittsburgh trying to raise money for this site. I said, ""Senator, I'm reluctant to go into a field that I don't know much about, but I promise you that if you'll support my school, I'll get it built and in a couple of years, I'll come back and weigh out that program that you desire.""

148,"Very soon they'll be doing everything for us. A very simple task, and it's interesting to see what kind of things came out of that. So if you look, you can see a lot of different machines come out of this. They all crawl in different ways, and you can see on the right, that we actually made a couple of these things, and they work in reality. These are not very fantastic robots, but they evolved to do exactly what we reward them for: for moving forward. So that was all done in simulation, but we can also do that on a real machine. They all get a ride on the machine, and they get rewarded for how fast or how far they can make the machine move forward. And you can see these robots are not ready to take over the world yet, but they gradually learn how to move forward, and they do this autonomously. But I want to show you a different approach, and this is this robot over here, which has four legs. You look at it and you see it has four legs, the machine doesn't know if it's a snake, if it's a tree, it doesn't have any idea what it looks like, but it's going to try to find that out. Initially, it does some random motion, and then it tries to figure out what it might look like. It kind of figured out what it looks like, and how to move forward, and then actually tried that out. And we've actually built a couple of these, and this is part of a larger robot made out of these cubes. So of course, this is a very crude machine, but we're working on a micro-scale version of these, and hopefully the cubes will be like a powder that you pour in. And one of the things that I think is important is that we have to get away from this idea of designing the machines manually, but actually let them evolve and learn, like children, and perhaps that's the way we'll get there.","The robots are not ready to take over the world yet, but they gradually learn how to move forward, and they do this autonomously.

149,"So this is a very attractive idea, because we're very lazy, like the Sorcerer's Apprentice, or the world's greatest computer programmer. How many of you know what I'm talking about? So now the thing is, this is a different kind of spell. And so, I'm here to tell you, you don't need a computer to actually have a spell. These are the kind of molecular programs we want to be able to write. We use DNA because it's cheaper, it's easier to handle, it's something we understand really well -- so well, in fact, that we think we can actually write programming languages for DNA and have molecular compilers. So then, we think we can do that. One of my first questions doing this was: How can you make an arbitrary shape or pattern out of DNA? I decided to use a type of DNA origami, where you take a long strand of DNA and fold it into whatever shape or pattern you might want. These short DNA sequences are what are going to fold the long strand into this shape that we want to make. So you send an e-mail with these sequences in it to a company, and the company pronounces them on a DNA synthesizer, a machine about the size of a photocopier. So you get 250 of these in the mail in little tubes. So the net effect of all 250 of these strands is to fold the long strand into the shape you're looking for. What we really want to do in the end is learn how to program self-assembly so we can build anything, right? And if it's the case that we can reach that level of complexity, if our ability to program molecules gets to be that good, then that will truly be magic.","""You don't need a computer to actually have a spell,"" he says.

154,"What's unusual about this one, maybe, is that it's from 1953. In terms of what we really need to do to put the brakes on this very high inertial thing -- our big economy -- we've really hardly started. And it's this stuff in the middle here, which is what you do if you don't stop the emissions quickly enough. Maybe they're going to land at the U.N. headquarters down the road here, or maybe they'll pick a smarter spot -- but suppose they arrive and they give you a box. And so I guess my view on this is not that I want to do it -- I do not -- but that we should move this out of the shadows and talk about it seriously. Because sooner or later, we'll be confronted with decisions about this, and it's better if we think hard about it, even if we want to think hard about reasons why we should never do it. I'll give you two different ways to think about this problem that are the beginning of my thinking about how to think about it. So here's one way to think about it, which is that we just do this instead of cutting emissions because it's cheaper. I guess the thing I haven't said about this is, it is absurdly cheap. Let's say that we don't do geo-engineering, we do what we ought to do, which is get serious about cutting emissions. But we don't really know how quickly we have to cut them. Right now, you have a few enthusiasts talking about it, some in a positive side, some in a negative side -- but that's a dangerous state to be in because there's very little depth of knowledge on this topic. I think there is a serious problem: as you talk about this, people begin to think they don't need to work so hard to cut emissions. But it might well be that, in fact, if China wakes up in 2030 and realizes that the climate impacts are just unacceptable, they may not be very interested in our moral conversations about how to do this, and they may just decide they'd really rather have a geo-engineered world than a non-geo-engineered world. And it's time to begin thinking about it, even if the reason we're thinking about it is to construct arguments for why we shouldn't do it.","CNN's John Sutter looks at a 1953 letter from President Eisenhower to the U.N.

155,"Now if we want to design a foot, what do we have to do? But if you wanted to really do research, what do you have to do? When we did that, here's a new experiment that we did: we put an animal and had it run -- this grass spider -- on a surface with 99 percent of the contact area removed. You can do another experiment where you can take a cockroach with a foot, and you can remove its foot. What you'll see, in fact, is that it's using that half circle leg as a distributed foot. You can see it here well on this debris. RF: So if you look carefully at this, what you see is that they have spines and until a few weeks ago, no one knew what they did. We did that by putting these artificial spines on crabs, as you see here, and then we tested them. Now just because we have a distributed foot and spines doesn't mean you can climb vertical surfaces. But look at this animal do it! It's extraordinary how fast it can do it -- but if you slow it down, you see something that's quite extraordinary. And here's the simple version of a foot for a new robot that I'll show you in a bit. This is the foot of an ant. This is when its foot's in the air. So the idea is to first get the toes and a foot right, attempt to make that climb, and ultimately put it on the robot.","A new type of spider foot allows it to climb vertical surfaces.

156,"Now, similarly, the old story about oil is that if we wanted to save very much of it, it would be expensive, or we would have done it already, because markets are essentially perfect. The United States, for example, can completely eliminate its use of oil and rejuvenate the economy at the same time, led by business for profit, because it's so much cheaper to save and substitute for the oil than to keep on buying it. We can save half the oil by using it more efficiently, at a cost of 12 dollars per saved barrel. You can sort of have it all with these things. And if you go over the next 15 years or so to a blended-wing body, kind of a flying wing with internal engines, then you get about a factor three efficiency improvement at comparable or lower cost. And the reason this has not been very seriously examined before is there was a common assumption in the industry that -- well, then it might not be safe if you got whacked by a heavy car, and it would cost a lot more to make, because the only way we know how to make cars much lighter was to use expensive light metals like aluminum and magnesium. And it turns out that these are quite remarkable for safety. We could make cars bigger, which is protective, but make them light. And when you make them light in the right way, that can be simpler and cheaper to make. Now, when you go through a similar analysis for every way we use oil, including buildings, industry, feedstocks and so on, you find that of the 28 million barrels a day the government says we will need in 2025, well, about eight of that can be removed by efficiency by then, with another seven still being saved as the vehicle stocks turn over, at an average cost of only 12 bucks a barrel, instead of 26 for buying the oil. There is a huge amount of gas to be saved, about half the projected gas at about an eighth of its price. Or we could use the saved gas directly to cover all of this balance, or if we used it as hydrogen, which is more profitable and efficient, we'd get rid of the domestic oil too. And at the same time to scrap inefficient old planes, so that if they were otherwise to come back in the air, they would waste more oil, and block the uptake of efficient, new planes.

160,"There must be a lot more, but those are at very, very small distances, and we haven't really interacted with them very much yet. The main thing I want to talk about is this: that we have this remarkable experience in this field of fundamental physics that beauty is a very successful criterion for choosing the right theory. I'll let you in on the answer to the last one that I offer, and that is, it has nothing to do with human beings. And someday, we may actually figure out the fundamental unified theory of the particles and forces, what I call the ""fundamental law."" But even if we don't run across it in our lifetimes, we can still think there is one out there, and we're just trying to get closer and closer to it. So what that means is that the history of the universe is not determined just by the fundamental law. So it's not a theory of everything. And in fact, a huge amount of the information in the universe around us comes from those accidents, and not just from the fundamental laws. Now, what happens is that as we do that, as we peel these skins of the onion, and we get closer and closer to the underlying law, we see that each skin has something in common with the previous one, and with the next one. And the kind of mathematics that we had for the previous skin is almost the same as what we need for the next skin. You look at gravity, you see a certain law.

The way we can square on most calculators -- let me demonstrate with this one -- is by taking the number, such as five, hitting ""times"" and then ""equals,"" and on most calculators that will give you the square. What I'm going to try and do now is to square, in my head, four two-digit numbers faster than they can do on their calculators, even using the shortcut method.

It didn't work very well on the schizophrenics, but it was pretty clear in the '30s and by the middle of the '40s that electroconvulsive therapy was very, very effective in the treatment of depression. And the reason that it has had a renaissance is that probably about 10 percent of the people, severe depressives, do not respond, regardless of what is done for them. But it wasn't that simple, because by the time I got out of that unit, I was not functional at all. And it was clear -- not to me, because nothing was clear to me at that time anymore -- that I would need long-term hospitalization in that awful place called a ""mental hospital."" Well, I was a grown man who had all of these rituals, and it got so there was a throbbing, there was a ferocious fear in my head. But there was one treatment, which actually had been pioneered at the Hartford Hospital in the early 1940s, and you can imagine what it was: it was prefrontal lobotomy. (Imitates a popping sound) So they decided -- I didn't know this, again, I found this out later -- that the only thing that could be done was for this 43-year-old man to have a prefrontal lobotomy. And of course, I had been there, what, three or four months at the time. He asked to meet with the senior staff, and they agreed to meet with him, because he was very well thought of in that place. If he does the best he can, he will have no further obsessions, probably no depression, but his affect will be dulled, he will never go back to surgery, he will never be the loving father that he was to his two children, his life will be changed. And by 20, I had the sense, I really had the sense, that I could overcome this, that I was now strong enough that by an act of will, I could blow the obsessional thinking away.

163,"(Laughter) There was a very important study done a while ago at Princeton Theological Seminary that speaks to why it is that when all of us have so many opportunities to help, we do sometimes, and we don't other times. What turned out to determine whether someone would stop and help a stranger in need was how much of a hurry they thought they were in -- were they feeling they were late, or were they absorbed in what they were going to talk about. But then the question is: Why don't we? And the simple fact is, if we are focused on ourselves, if we're preoccupied, as we so often are throughout the day, we don't really fully notice the other. I was doing my taxes the other day, and I got to the point where I was listing all of the donations I gave, and I had an epiphany, it was -- I came to my check to the Seva Foundation and I noticed that I thought, boy, my friend Larry Brilliant would really be happy that I gave money to Seva. I was at a sushi restaurant a while back and I overheard two women talking about the brother of one woman, who was in the singles scene. I don't know if you know speed dating? The test was: from the moment they got together, how long it would take the guy to ask her a question with the word ""you"" in it. There is a newly coined word in the English language for the moment when the person we're with whips out their BlackBerry or answers that cell phone, and all of a sudden we don't exist. So at one point, my brother-in-law gets up the courage to ask the one question he really wants to know the answer to, and that is: how could you have done it? And I think that that is very troubling, and in a sense, I've been reflecting on turning that part of us off. Once you can track it back to the factory, you can look at the manufacturing processes that were used to make it, and if it's virtuous, you can label it that way. Or if it's not so virtuous, you can go into -- today, go into any store, put your scanner on a palm onto a barcode, which will take you to a website. And all of a sudden as I was going down the stairs I noticed that there was a man slumped to the side, shirtless, not moving, and people were just stepping over him -- hundreds and hundreds of people.

So suddenly, I was interested in human-powered flight -- (Laughter) -- and did not -- the way I approached it, first, thinking about ways to make the planes, was just like they'd been doing in England, and not succeeding, and I gave it up. (Laughter) But that sure started me thinking about various things, and immediately, we began making a solar-powered plane because we felt solar power was going to be so important for the country and the world, we didn't want the small funding in the government to be decreased, which is what the government was trying to do with it. And we thought a solar-powered plane wouldn't really make sense, but you could do it and it would get a lot of publicity for solar power and maybe help that field.

And all of these robotic missions are part of a bigger human journey: a voyage to understand something, to get a sense of our cosmic place, to understand something of our origins, and how Earth, our planet, and we, living on it, came to be. I can't show you all the beautiful pictures that we've taken in the last two and a half years, because I simply don't have the time. They range in size from a few kilometers across to as big across as the U.S. It has a very large, thick atmosphere, and in fact, its surface environment was believed to be more like the environment we have here on the Earth, or at least had in the past, than any other body in the solar system. And so it turns out that methane is to Titan what water is to the Earth. (Laughter) That is the view that we had of the surface of Titan before we got there with Cassini,   and I can tell you that what we have found on Titan, though it is not the same in detail, is every bit as fascinating as that story is. And what you see is bright and dark regions, and that's about as far as it got for us. This, we later found out, is, in fact, a crater, but there are very few craters on the surface of Titan, meaning it's a very young surface. We deployed it to the atmosphere of Titan, it took two and a half hours to descend, and it landed on the surface. It is so significant that, in my mind, this was an event that should have been celebrated with ticker tape parades in every city across the U.S. and Europe, and sadly, that wasn't the case.

But what I've been trying to do is something that the curators at MoMA in my department have been doing ever since the museum was founded in 1929, which is to try and see what's going on in the world and try to use that authority in order to make things better. There have been many episodes, and actually Eames Demetrius may be here in the audience, but in two instances, his great-grandfather, grandfather -- I'm always a little perplexed about the relation, exactly -- Charles Eames the first time and then Charles and Ray Eames the second time were involved in two competitions: one in 1940, it was about organic furniture, and the second one in 1948 was low-cost furniture for the GIs coming back from the war that then sparked a whole line of furniture. And then, for instance, this other exhibition that was entitled Workspheres in 2001, where I asked different designers to come up with ideas for the new type of work styles that were happening in the world at that time. Tony Dunne and Fiona Raby did this series of objects that are about our anguish and our paranoia, like this hideaway furniture that's made in the same wood as your floor so it disappears completely and you can hide away; or even better, the huggable atomic mushroom, which got me an article on the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists of the United States -- I don't think it ever happened before at MoMA; or this Faraday Chair that is supposed to protect you from radiations. But the interesting thing in the exhibition is the discovery that the ultimate shelter is your sense of self, and there are quite a few designers that are working on this particular topic. They're quite beautiful. And it was really interesting because I was the last speaker and before me there were people that were really talking about luxury, and I didn't want to be a party pooper but at the same time I felt that I had to kind of bring back the discourse to reality. So they're quite beautiful, but they're beautiful because they're so smart and economical. (Laughter) It's quite beautiful because somehow, this is a gorgeous moment for design. For instance, this is a beautiful container for asthma medicine that kind of inflates itself when it's time for you to take the medicine, so the child has to go -- pffff!","I think of heaven as a really comfortable cloud where I can just lie down with my belly down, like I was watching TV when I was a child, and my elbows up.

173,"And that's been called the face area in the brain, because when it's damaged, you can no longer recognize people's faces. Well, what you do is, if you take any one of you here, and put you in front of a screen, and measure your galvanic skin response, and show pictures on the screen, I can measure how you sweat when you see an object, like a table or an umbrella. (Laughter) Now, what happens if you show this patient? So his vision is normal because the visual areas are normal, his emotions are normal -- he'll laugh, he'll cry, so on and so forth -- but the wire from vision to emotions is cut and therefore he has this delusion that his mother is an impostor. One of the things we've found was, about half the patients with phantom limbs claim that they can move the phantom. So the patient had an actual arm, which is painful, in a sling for a few months or a year, and then, in a misguided attempt to get rid of the pain in the arm, the surgeon amputates the arm, and then you get a phantom arm with the same pains, right? He had a phantom arm, excruciatingly painful, and he couldn't move it. (Applause) My first patient came in, and he looked in the mirror, and I said, ""Look at your reflection of your phantom."" He said, ""Oh, I can't move my phantom. So he said OK, and he took it home. (Laughter) ""So, can you change the design and put it on my forehead, so I can, you know, do this and eliminate my phantom fingers?"" And your motor command saying there is an arm, and, because of this conflict, the brain says, to hell with it, there is no phantom, there is no arm, right? OK, what is synesthesia? So, we found that the color area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain, in the fusiform gyrus. Now, this is very important, because what it's telling you is your brain is engaging in a primitive -- it's just -- it looks like a silly illusion, but these photons in your eye are doing this shape, and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern, but the brain is able to extract the common denominator.","When the face area in the brain is damaged, you can no longer recognize people's faces.

174,"Not because there was not enough food -- because there was actually a surplus of food in the fertile regions of the south parts of the country -- but because in the north, people could not access or entitle themselves to that food. And most of Africa's farmers are, by and large, small farmers in terms of land that they operate, and very, very small farmers in terms of the capital they have at their disposal. I think we're all in this room, probably, because we know that, in fact, Africa is the only region in the world where hunger and malnutrition are projected to go up over the next 10 years, where the food import bill is now double what it was 20 years ago, where food production per capita has stagnated, and where fertilizer use has declined rather than increased. And this is not just specific to Ethiopia, but happens over and over, all over Africa. There was a very influential book about that, which was mainly about getting governments out of the market. When conditions are right, we know and see that that innovation is ready to explode in rural Africa, just like anywhere else. After having spent more than a decade understanding, studying, and trying to convince policymakers and donors about what was wrong with Africa's agricultural markets, I decided it was time to do something about it. Now, the commodity exchange itself, that concept, is not new to the world. This innovation is at the heart of the transformation of American agriculture, and the rise of Chicago to a global market, agricultural market, superpower from where it was, a small regional town. So, the ECX is an Ethiopian exchange for Ethiopia. And this is because one of the things we've learned over the last decade of studying market development in Africa is that the piecemeal approach does not work. At the same time, what's very fundamental to this market is that -- and again, an innovation that we've designed for our exchange -- is that the exchange will operate warehouses around the country, in which grade certification and warehouse receipting will be done. Whereas before the farmer used to think local -- meaning that he or she would go to the nearest local market, eight to 10 kilometers away on average, and sell whatever they happened to have, without any idea of what the price premium or anything else was -- now farmers come with knowledge of what prices are at the national market. Can Ethiopia do this? The will is there.","Africa is the only region in the world where hunger and malnutrition are projected to go up over the next 10 years.

175,"Now in the 1980s, I happened to notice that if you look at an aerial photograph of an African village, you see fractals. And of course I had to go to Africa and ask folks why. (Laughter) And so I finally got to this city, and I'd done a little fractal model for the city just to see how it would sort of unfold -- but when I got there, I got to the palace of the chief, and my French is not very good; I said something like, ""I am a mathematician and I would like to stand on your roof."" But he was really cool about it, and he took me up there, and we talked about fractals. So here's a little fractal model for it. Here's one house with the sacred altar, here's the house of houses, the family enclosure, with the humans here where the sacred altar would be, and then here's the village as a whole -- a ring of ring of rings with the chief's extended family here, the chief's immediate family here, and here there's a tiny village only this big. Well, I noticed that line is about where the only square building in the village is at. So, when I got to the village, I said, ""Can you take me to the square building? And finally, well, isn't this just intuition? He said, ""Well, if I lived in the jungle, I would only use the long rows of straw because they're very quick and they're very cheap. You can find it on the East Coast as well as the West Coast, and often the symbols are very well preserved, so each of these symbols has four bits -- it's a four-bit binary word -- you draw these lines in the sand randomly, and then you count off, and if it's an odd number, you put down one stroke, and if it's an even number, you put down two strokes. And I started explaining why I was there in Africa, and they got very excited when they saw the Cantor set. And of course, I was only interested in the math, so the whole time, he kept shaking his head going, ""You know, I didn't learn it this way."" So it's really very successful teaching children that they have a heritage that's about mathematics, that it's not just about singing and dancing. We got a small seed grant, just to see if folks would be willing to work with us on this; we're very excited about the future possibilities for that.","In the 1980s, I happened to notice that if you look at an aerial photograph of an African village, you see fractals.

176,"I study ants, and that's because I like to think about how organizations work. So, ant colonies are a good example of an organization like that, and there are many others. So every year, on the same day -- and it's a mystery exactly how that happens -- each colony sends out its virgin, unmated queens with wings, and the males, and they all fly to a common place. They go out, they get the food, they dig the nest, and the queen never comes out again. And then this is how colony size and numbers of worker ants changes -- so this is about 10,000 worker ants -- changes as a function of colony age, in years. That's not just how is the colony organized, but how does it change what it's doing? So you see the nest maintenance workers come out with a bit of sand, put it down, turn around, and go back in. So just to reinforce that what you might have thought about ant queens isn't true -- you know, even if the queen did have the intelligence to send chemical messages through this whole network of chambers to tell the ants outside what to do, there is no way that such messages could make it in time to see the shifts in the allocation of workers that we actually see outside the nest. And what I wanted to know was, ""OK, here's a situation where extra nest maintenance workers were recruited -- is this going to have any effect on the workers performing other tasks?"" But if more nest maintenance work is needed -- for example, if I put out a bunch of toothpicks -- then nobody will ever switch back to nest maintenance, they have to get nest maintenance workers from inside the nest. So, for example, when there's extra nest maintenance work to do, it's not that the foragers switch over. When one ant touches another, it's smelling it, and it can tell, for example, whether the other ant is a nest mate because ants cover themselves and each other, through grooming, with a layer of grease, which carries a colony-specific odor. And what we're learning is that an ant uses the pattern of its antennal contacts, the rate at which it meets ants of other tasks, in deciding what to do. They've gone out to do different tasks, and the rate at which they meet as they come in and out of the nest entrance determines, or influences, each ant's decision about whether to go out, and which task to perform. You can also see this in the ants just outside the nest entrance like these.","I study ants, and that's because I like to think about how organizations work.

She asks: How do these chitinous creatures get down to business -- and even multitask when they need to -- with no language, memory or visible leadership? Her answers could lead to a better understanding of all complex systems, from the brain to the Web. Thanks, ants."

178,"I then went on to make more comments on the media and press imagery, so I started making reference to media imagery -- made it grainy, shot through doorways and so on and so forth -- to titillate the public or the viewer further in terms of trying to make the viewer more aware of their own voyeurism. So, this is an image of Diana looking at Camilla kissing her husband, and this was a sequence of images. This is Jane Smith and Jo Bloggs, for instance, but you think it's Camilla and the Queen, and I'm fascinated how what you think is real isn't necessarily real. And that is the way, I think, that celebrity magazines work now: the more pictures you see of these celebrities, the more you feel you know them, but you don't know them and you want to know them further. And then I was sort of making imagery. Which I found very interesting that it was going full cycle: I was making comments about the press and about how we know facts and information only by media -- because we don't know the real people; very few of us know the real people -- but it was going back into the press and they were publicizing, effectively, my filthy work. And me as the Queen. She looks nothing like Marilyn, but by the time we've made her up and put wigs and makeup on, she looks exactly like Marilyn, to the extent that her husband couldn't recognize her -- or recognize this look-alike -- in these photographs, which I find quite interesting. Then I made a book. You know, what does Tony Blair get up to in private with his fashion guru? This image is quite interesting, actually, because I think we made it three years ago. It's obviously a very big commercial company, and so this little, ""Shh -- it's not really them,"" was put on the side of the imagery. Also, people were taking photographs of this, so it was being texted around the world extremely quickly, all this imagery. And I think it doesn't really matter that my work is considered humorous, in a way; I think it's a way in for me to deal with the importance of imagery and how we read all our information through imagery. I mean, it's extremely difficult to find these look-alikes, so I'm constantly going up to people in the street and trying to ask people to come and be in one of my photographs or films.","I then went on to make more comments on the media and press imagery, so I started making reference to media imagery.

179,"This is your conference, and I think you have a right to know a little bit right now, in this transition period, about this guy who's going to be looking after it for you for a bit. Two years ago at TED, I think -- I've come to this conclusion -- I think I may have been suffering from a strange delusion. It's called Future; it was a magazine publishing company. I thought the little graph of my business life that kind of looked a bit like Moore's Law -- ever upward and to the right -- it was going to go on forever. And the way in which you could think about us as a species and us as a planet had just changed so much, and it was incredibly exciting. And what was really most exciting -- and I think Richard Wurman discovered this at least 20 years before I did -- was that all this stuff is connected. And when you think about it, it's very true: what we all most desire is a penis -- or ""happiness"" as we say in English. (Laughter) (Applause) But something as basic as happiness, which 20 years ago would have been just something for discussion in the church or mosque or synagogue, today it turns out that there's dozens of TED-like questions that you can ask about it, which are really interesting. You can view it in sort of geopolitical terms and say, why is it that a billion people on this planet are so desperately needy that they have no possibility of happiness, and whereas almost all the rest of them, regardless of how much money they have -- whether it's two dollars a day or whatever -- are almost equally happy on average? And so on, and so on. To understand even something as important to us as happiness, you kind of have to branch off in all these different directions, and there's nowhere that I've discovered -- other than TED -- where you can ask that many questions in that many different directions. It really is. (Laughter) So, I gave myself the job title of TED Custodian for a reason, and I will promise you right here and now that the core values that make TED special are not going to be interfered with. That's not going to be changed at all. Already, just in the last few days, we've had so many people talking about stuff that they care about, that they're passionate about, that can make a difference in the world, and the idea of getting this group of people together -- some of the causes that we believe in, the money that this conference can raise and the ideas -- I really believe that that combination will, over time, make a difference.","This is your conference, and I think you have a right to know a little bit right now, in this transition period, about this guy who's going to be looking after it for you for a bit.

180,"In a few months, the world is also going to celebrate the launch of a new invention from Microsoft Research, which I think is going to have as profound an impact on the way we view the universe as Galileo did four centuries ago. It's called the WorldWide Telescope, and I want to thank TED and Microsoft for allowing me to bring it to your attention. It's going to change the way we do astronomy, it's going to change the way we teach astronomy and I think most importantly it's going to change the way we see ourselves in the universe. In 1920, for example, you weren't allowed to drink; if you were a woman, you weren't allowed to vote; and if you looked up at the stars and the Milky Way on a summer night, what you saw was thought to be the entire universe. We can see all the way out to the edge of the observable universe, all the way back in time, almost to the moment of the Big Bang itself. We see alien worlds, we see alien solar systems -- 300 now, and still counting -- and they're not like us. But until now, our view of the universe has been disconnected and fragmented, and I think that many of the marvelous stories that nature has to tell us have fallen through the cracks. And in telling stories, each of us is going to understand the universe in our own way. Before I introduce the person responsible for the WorldWide Telescope, I just want to leave you with this brief thought: when I ask people, ""How does the night sky make you feel?"" And thanks to the creators of the WorldWide Telescope, we can now start to have a dialogue with the universe.

181,"Sometimes I make a lot of drawings and I still don't understand what it is I'm drawing. Maybe I should get away from this map completely, and really be honest about wanting to show you my favorite bits and pieces of Rome and simply kick a soccer ball in the air -- which happens in so many of the squares in the city -- and let it bounce off of things. The text here is right side and upside down so that you are forced to turn the book around, and you can see it from ground point of view and from her point of view -- looking in the hole, getting a different kind of perspective, moving you around the space. At the end of lunch, they untie the anchor, they set off through the Baths of Caracalla and over the walls of the city and then an abandoned gatehouse and decide to take one more look at the Pyramid of Cestius, which has this lightning rod on top.

He's looking at his table; he's planning to propose this evening to his girlfriend of 40 years, (Laughter) and he wants it to be perfect. So they all have his number.

I could peel out a page of this palazzo to show you what's going on inside of it. OK, if I don't open the book the whole way, if I just open it 90 degrees, we're looking down the front of the Pantheon, and we're looking sort of at the top, more or less down on the square.

182,"And there was a day about seven years ago: I was planting potatoes, it was the first week of May -- this is New England, when the apple trees are just vibrating with bloom; they're just white clouds above. We have a grammar that suggests that's who we are; that we are sovereign subjects in nature, the bee as well as me. We know that what's going on between the bee and that flower is that bee has been cleverly manipulated by that flower. And that's when I got the idea, which was, ""Well, what would happen if we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who are working on us?"" And I realized that in the same way you can look at a flower and deduce all sorts of interesting things about the taste and the desires of bees -- that they like sweetness, that they like this color and not that color, that they like symmetry -- what could we find out about ourselves by doing the same thing? Now, the test of any idea -- I said it was a literary conceit -- is what does it get us? (Laughter) We have this intellectual, this Darwinian revolution in which, thanks to Darwin, we figured out we are just one species among many; evolution is working on us the same way it's working on all the others; we are acted upon as well as acting; we are really in the fiber, the fabric of life. But, you know, there's a comedian who said, ""Well, who's telling me that consciousness is so good and so important? So when you look at the plants, you realize that there are other tools and they're just as interesting. And I'm going to take you to a farm right now, because I used this idea to develop my understanding of the food system and what I learned, in fact, is that we are all, now, being manipulated by corn. It's based on this idea that we bend other species to our will and that we are in charge, and that we create these factories and we have these technological inputs and we get the food out of it or the fuel or whatever we want. Let me take you to a very different kind of farm. And this is a lot more than growing food, as you'll see; this is a different way to think about nature and a way to get away from the zero-sum notion, the Cartesian idea that either nature's winning or we're winning, and that for us to get what we want, nature is diminished. And what I realized when I understood this -- and if you ask Joel Salatin what he is, he'll tell you he's not a chicken farmer, he's not a sheep farmer, he's not a cattle rancher; he's a grass farmer, because grass is really the keystone species of such a system -- is that, if you think about it, this completely contradicts the tragic idea of nature we hold in our heads, which is that for us to get what we want, nature is diminished. And what it tells you is that if you begin to take account of other species, take account of the soil, that even with nothing more than this perspectival idea -- because there is no technology involved here except for those fences, which are so cheap they could be all over Africa in no time -- that we can take the food we need from the Earth and actually heal the Earth in the process.","""We have a grammar that suggests that's who we are,"" he says.

184,"And the other is that there is an incredible opportunity if we choose the right wireless technologies; how we can generate a new engine for economic growth and dramatically reduce C02 in the other sectors. Not only do I have a fleet of cars available to me in seven cities around the world that I can have at my beck and call, but heaven forbid I would ever maintain or deal with the repair or have anything to do with it. So, what is the social result of this? It required that it was completely trivial: that it takes 30 seconds to reserve a car, go get it, drive it. You know it's going to really transform how we feel about travel, and it will also, I think, enhance our freedom of mobility. And it's the cost of driving that's making people want to be able to do this. In London, the day they turned the congestion pricing on, there was a 25 percent decrease in congestion overnight, and that's persisted for the four years in which they've been doing congestion pricing. And as we get our cars more fuel-efficient, that's going to be reducing the amount of revenue that you get off of those gas taxes, so we need to charge people by the mile that they drive. And if we have it, you'll decide how many miles to drive, what mode of travel, where to live and work. When are we going to do it? Are we going to wait 10 to 15 years for this to happen or are we going to finally have this political will to make it happen in the next two years? So, the examples that I gave you are these islands of mesh networks, and networks are interesting only as they are big. Because we're going to do congestion pricing, we are going to do road tolls, gas taxes are going to become road pricing. When are we going to do it? And we can be doing it if we could just get over the fact that this little slice of things is going to be for free.","It takes 30 seconds to reserve a car, go get it, drive it.

185,"We're actually starting at a new point: we've been digitizing biology, and now we're trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthesizing life. This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, that has the smallest genome for a species that can self-replicate in the laboratory, and we've been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome. We're able to knock out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here. And if we do, can we boot up a chromosome? A chromosome, by the way, is just a piece of inert chemical material. There are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of DNA -- 30 to 50 letters in length -- and it's a degenerate process, so the longer you make the piece, the more errors there are. But we wanted to go much larger: we wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome -- it's over 580,000 letters of genetic code -- so we thought we'd build them in cassettes the size of the viruses so we could actually vary the cassettes to understand what the actual components of a living cell are. Part of the design is designing pieces that are 50 letters long that have to overlap with all the other 50-letter pieces to build smaller subunits we have to design so they can go together. And we started making pieces, starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7,000 letters, put those together to make 24,000-letter pieces, then put sets of those going up to 72,000. With bacteria and Archaea, the chromosome is integrated into the cell, but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it. We purified a chromosome from one microbial species -- roughly, these two are as distant as human and mice -- we added a few extra genes so we could select for this chromosome, we digested it with enzymes to kill all the proteins, and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell -- and you'll appreciate our very sophisticated graphics here. Now I've argued, this is not genesis; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution. We're about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years. We now, from our discovery around the world, have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think of these as the design components of the future. This is a screen snapshot of some true design software that we're working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer.","We've been digitizing biology, and now we're trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthesizing life.

186,"How do you discover the uniqueness of a project as unique as a person? And so I'll take you to Wichita, Kansas, where I was asked some years ago to do a science museum on a site, right downtown by the river. (Laughter) And so the process began and they said, ""You can't put it all on an island; some of it has to be on the mainland because we don't want to turn our back to the community."" And there emerged a design: the galleries sort of forming an island and you could walk through them or on the roof. It was, what I would say, compositional complexity, and I felt that if I had to fulfill what I talked about -- a building for science -- there had to be some kind of a generating idea, some kind of a generating geometry. (Applause) In 1976, I was asked to design a children's memorial museum in a Holocaust museum in Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, which you see here the campus. I worked on it for months and I couldn't deal with it because I felt people were coming out of the historic museum, they are totally saturated with information and to see yet another museum with information, it would make them just unable to digest. And I got to work and they took me somewhere down there, nine kilometers away from the town and the temple, and said, ""That's where we have chosen the location."" Let's get back to the town and walk to the site."" And as you come from the north, it is all masonry growing out of the sand cliffs as you come from the Himalayas and evoking the tradition of the fortress. And all of it, then, all the galleries are underground, and you see the openings for the light. That too was a competition, and it is something I'm just beginning to work on. If it were to be anywhere in Washington, it would be an office building, a conference center, a place for negotiating peace and so on -- all of which the building is -- but by virtue of the choice of putting it on the Mall and by the Lincoln Memorial, this becomes the structure that is the symbol of peace on the Mall. And what I felt about that building is that it really was a building that had to do with a lightness of being -- to quote Kundera -- that it had to do with whiteness, it had to do with a certain dynamic quality and it had to do with optimism.

187,"Get back into my body now."" (Laughter) Usually when I play out, the first thing that happens is people scream out, ""What's she doing?!"" Well, what I'm doing is controlling the pitch with my left hand. (Tones) So basically, with both of your hands you're controlling pitch and volume and kind of trying to create the illusion that you're doing separate notes, when really it's continuously going ...

(Music) (Applause) So, I'm trying to think of some of the questions that are commonly asked; there are so many. And there'd be that sound in the signal -- it's like (Screeching) -- and he thought, ""Oh, what if I could control that sound and turn it into an instrument, because there are pitches in it.""

You're really sensitive to your body and its functions when you're behind this thing. It reminds me of the balancing act earlier on -- what Michael was doing -- because you're fighting so hard to keep the balance with what you're playing with and stay in tune, and at the same time you don't want to focus so much on being in tune all the time; you want to be feeling the music. And then also, you're trying to stay very, very, very still because little movements with other parts of your body will affect the pitch, or sometimes if you're holding a low note -- (Tone rising out of key) -- and breathing will make it ... (Laughter)  If I pass out on the next song ... (Laughter) I think of it almost like like a yoga instrument because it makes you so aware of every little crazy thing your body is doing, or just aware of what you don't want it to be doing while you're playing; you don't want to have any sudden movements. And it's like, ""Well, I'm about to go on soon; I don't want to be like -- (Teetering tones) -- you know?"" It really does reflect the mood that you're in also, if you're ... it's similar to being a vocalist, except instead of it coming out of your throat, you're controlling it just in the air and you don't really have a point of reference; you're always relying on your ears and adjusting constantly.

And again, we have no way of knowing, but it's clear that a new form of wealth must have emerged. Again, we can't know, but we can be pretty sure that some form of symbolic communication must have been involved. I'm going to talk briefly about two of them: the prisoner's dilemma and the tragedy of the commons. Now, when I talked about this with Kevin Kelly, he assured me that everybody in this audience pretty much knows the details of the prisoner's dilemma, so I'm just going to go over that very, very quickly. Neither one wants to be the first one or they're going to get the sucker's payoff, but both lose, of course, because they don't get what they want. Another economic game that may not be as well known as the prisoner's dilemma is the ultimatum game, and it's also a very interesting probe of our assumptions about the way people make economic transactions. Here's how the game is played: there are two players; they've never played the game before, they will not play the game again, they don't know each other, and they are, in fact, in separate rooms. I simply want you to keep in mind that if in the past, new forms of cooperation enabled by new technologies create new forms of wealth, we may be moving into yet another economic form that is significantly different from previous ones. eBay solved the prisoner's dilemma and created a market where none would have existed by creating a feedback mechanism that turns a prisoner's dilemma game into an assurance game. Instead of, ""Neither of us can trust each other, so we have to make suboptimal moves,"" it's, ""You prove to me that you are trustworthy and I will cooperate."" And I don't have enough time to talk about all of them, but think about self-interest. This is all about self-interest that adds up to more. I think we need to begin developing maps of this territory so that we can talk about it across disciplines.

I thought it was quite an interesting experiment in the principles of rocket science. 2-stage rockets with video cameras on them, onboard computers logging their flights, rocket gliders that fly back to Earth.

In fact, they're not: it's really a very, very high-resolution input medium -- you have to just do it twice, you have to touch the screen and then rotate your finger slightly -- and you can move a cursor with great accuracy. Well, the one advantage is that you don't have to pick them up, and people don't realize how important that is -- not having to pick up your fingers to use them. (Laughter) When you think for a second of the mouse on Macintosh -- and I will not criticize the mouse too much -- when you're typing -- what you have -- you want to now put something -- first of all, you've got to find the mouse.

196,"But there it is: ""JÃ³ napot, pacÃ¡k"" I said somebody here must surely know, because despite the fact that there aren't that many Hungarians to begin with, and the further fact that, so far as I know, there's not a drop of Hungarian blood in my veins, at every critical juncture of my life there has been a Hungarian friend or mentor there beside me. He was ostracized as a child, not because he was a Jew -- his parents weren't very religious anyhow -- but because he had been born with two club feet, a condition which, in those days, required institutionalization and a succession of painful operations between the ages of one and 11. He went to the commercial business high school as a young man in Budapest, and there he was as smart as he was modest and he enjoyed a considerable success. But Mr. Teszler answered, ""No, that will not be necessary. And then one day, it happened: he and his family were arrested and they were taken to a death house on the Danube. And in a twist you would not believe in a Steven Spielberg film -- the Gauleiter who was overseeing this brutal beating was the very same thief who had stolen socks from Mr. Teszler's hosiery mill. Mr. Teszler said, ""You are being paid twice the wages of any other textile workers in this region and this is how we do business. And one of the white foremen stepped forward and said, ""You are being paid twice the wages of any other workers in this industry in this region and this is how we do business. Before I got there, the library of the college had been named for Mr. Teszler, and after I arrived in 1993, the faculty decided to honor itself by naming Mr. Teszler Professor of the College -- partly because at that point he had already taken all of the courses in the catalog, but mainly because he was so conspicuously wiser than any one of us. It was only after Mr. Teszler's death that I learned that the marker on the grave of Bela Bartok in Hartsdale, New York was paid for by Sandor Teszler. They would not leave me alone until I let them have a piece, but it was not a good one."" (Laughter) Well, it occurred to me that I should invite Dr. Robicsek to lecture at Wofford College on -- what else?

200,"Something that motivates me, and gets me really excited about my research, is when I see simple opportunities to drastically change that distribution and make the technology accessible to a much wider percentage of the population. So here, I have my computer set up with the projector, and I have a Wii Remote sitting on top of it. And, for example, if you're in a school that doesn't have a lot money, probably a lot of schools, or if you're in an office environment, and you want an interactive whiteboard, normally these cost about two to three thousand dollars. So I'm going to show you how to create one with a Wii Remote. Now, what this means is that if I run this piece of software, the camera sees the infrared dot, and I can register the location of the camera pixels to the projector pixels. (Applause) So for about $50 of hardware, you can have your own whiteboard. (Laughter) The software for this I've actually put on my website and have let people download it for free. (Applause) For the second demo, I have this Wii Remote that's actually next to the TV. And why this is interesting is that if you put on, say, a pair of safety glasses, that have two infrared dots in them, they are going to give the computer an approximation of your head location. And why this is interesting is I have this sort of application running on the computer monitor, which has a 3D room, with some targets floating in it. And you can see that it looks like a 3D room. But if we turn on head tracking -- the computer can change the image that's on the screen and make it respond to the head movements.

203,"The questions I would like to talk about are: one, where did we come from? Are we alone in the universe? Is there alien life out there? If we extrapolate back, we find we must have all been on top of each other about 15 billion years ago. And second, there was no question of the initial state of the universe. We have made good progress on the first part, and now have the knowledge of the laws of evolution in all but the most extreme conditions. However, this division into laws of evolution and initial conditions depends on time and space being separate and distinct. I now turn to the second big question: are we alone, or is there other life in the universe? The first is that we have fossils of algae from 3.5 billion years ago. On the other hand, we don't seem to have been visited by aliens. Our only chance of long-term survival is not to remain inward-looking on planet Earth, but to spread out into space. The answers to these big questions show that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years. But if we want to continue beyond the next hundred years, our future is in space.

204,"I mean, all the projects which have, in some way, been inspired by that agenda are about a celebratory lifestyle, in a way celebrating the places and the spaces which determine the quality of life. And I think it was July 20, 1969, when, for the first time, man could look back at planet Earth. If you looked at the buildings together with the associated transport, in other words, the transport of people, which is 26 percent, then 70 percent of the energy consumption is influenced by the way that our cites and infrastructure work together. So the problems of sustainability cannot be separated from the nature of the cities, of which the buildings are a part. If you take China, and you just take Beijing, you can see on that traffic system, and the pollution associated with the consumption of energy as the cars expand at the price of the bicycles. If I pull back from that global picture, and I look at the implication over a similar period of time in terms of the technology -- which, as a tool, is a tool for designers, and I cite our own experience as a company, and I just illustrate that by a small selection of projects -- then how do you measure that change of technology? So the humanistic ideal is very, very strong in all this work, encapsulated perhaps by one of my early sketches here, where you can see greenery, you can see sunlight, you have a connection with nature. And the award was about a celebration for a building which had been in use over a long period of time. The image at the top, what it doesn't -- if you look at it in detail, really what it is saying is you can wire this building. And what they were saying on this occasion was that our competitors had to build new buildings for the new technology. In other words, we didn't have the technology to do what would be really interesting on that building. I mean, this is a glimpse of the interior of our Hong Kong bank of 1979, which opened in 1985, with the ability to be able to reflect sunlight deep into the heart of this space here. Obviously the wind tunnel had a place, but the ability now with the computer to explore, to plan, to see how that would work in terms of the forces of nature: natural ventilation, to be able to model the chamber below, and to look at biomass. But again, very much about the lifestyle, the quality -- something that would be more enjoyable as a place to work.

We will be able to fly into the anatomy of Peter's brain -- literally, fly into his body -- but more importantly, we can look into his mind. Now you've seen before that with electrodes you can control robotic arms, that brain imaging and scanners can show you the insides of brains. We've collapsed that through technology to milliseconds, and that allows us to let Peter to look at his brain in real time as he's inside the scanner. If he can see this pattern in his own brain, he can learn how to control it. This is a fourth alternative that you are soon going to have. If we can look at the activation in the brain that's producing the pain, we can form 3D models and watch in real time the brain process information, and then we can select the areas that produce the pain. Now imagine that you will soon be able to look inside your brain and select brain areas to do that same thing.

206,"And I'm also rather surprised, because when I look back on my life the last thing I ever wanted to do was write, or be in any way involved in religion. And it has been the study of other religious traditions that brought me back to a sense of what religion can be, and actually enabled me to look at my own faith in a different light. And religious doctrines are meant to be summons to action; you only understand them when you put them into practice. And it is an arresting fact that right across the board, in every single one of the major world faiths, compassion -- the ability to feel with the other in the way we've been thinking about this evening -- is not only the test of any true religiosity, it is also what will bring us into the presence of what Jews, Christians and Muslims call ""God"" or the ""Divine.""

The importance of this is that this is -- I can see some of you starting to look worried, because you think it's a slow and cumbersome body -- but what the United Nations can do is give us some neutrality, so that this isn't seen as a Western or a Christian initiative, but that it's coming, as it were, from the United Nations, from the world -- who would help with the sort of bureaucracy of this.

The third idea I want to share with you is that music, paradoxically, I think even more than words, is one of the very best ways we have of showing who we really are. I think that's true for many of us, and I want to give you two examples of how music is one of the most powerful interfaces we have, from ourselves to the outside world. So, he figures out a way to download himself into his environment, actually into a series of books. And the opera is about what we can share, what we can pass on to others, to the people we love, and what we can't. And I'd like now to invite two very special people on the stage, so that I can give you an example of what personal instruments might be like. This is by far the farthest he's strayed from Tewksbury Hospital, I can tell you that, because he's motivated to meet with you today and show you his own music. What Adam's been working on for this last period is not only how to have Dan be able easily to make his own pieces, but how he can perform his piece using this kind of personal instrument. And it's in his face, it's in his breathing, it's in his eyes. TM: So Dan is going to play a piece of his, called ""My Eagle Song"". So that's the way he made his piece, and as Adam says, we then figured out the best way to have him perform his piece. It's going to be looked at by this camera, analyze his movements, it's going to let Dan bring out all the different aspects of his music that he wants to. I think it gives an understanding of how we're picking out movement from what Dan's doing, but I think it will also show you, if you look at that movement, that when Dan makes music, his motions are very purposeful, very precise, very disciplined and they're also very beautiful.","But music is even more powerful if you don't just listen to it, but you make it yourself.

208,"And all I'm going to try and prove to you with these slides is that I do just very straight stuff. (Laughter) The piece on the left -- and that ultimately led to the piece on the right -- happened when the kid that was working on this took one of those long strings of stuff and folded it up to put it in the wastebasket. And a lot of my architectural ideas that came from it -- accidental, again -- it was an intuitive kind of thing, and I just kept going with it, and made this proposal for a building, which was only a proposal. I went into the metal because it was a way of building a building that was a sculpture. He'd made a building with a dome and he had a little tower. That big metal thing is a passage, and in it is -- you go downstairs into the living room and then down into the bedroom, which is on the right. And a long time ago, about '82 or something, after my house -- I designed a house for myself that would be a village of several pavilions around a courtyard -- and the owner of this lot worked for me and built that actual model on the left. But when you're in that room, you feel like you're on a kind of barge on some kind of lake. And so it was an intent to make this small piece of land -- it's 100 by 250 -- into a kind of an estate by separating these areas and making the living room and dining room into this pavilion with a high space in it. (Laughter) There it is. And this piece here is -- I don't know what it is. And I don't gave good slides to show -- it's just been completed -- but this piece here is this building, and these pieces here and here. And I was asked to do a fish, and so I did a snake. And so we took the language of this exposed steel and used it, perverted it, into the form of the fish, and created a kind of a 19th-century contraption that looks like, that will sit -- this is the beach and the harbor out in front, and this is really a shopping center with department stores. I didn't expect Lou Danziger to be here, but this is a building I did for him in 1964, I think.","A lot of my architectural ideas that came from it -- accidental, again -- it was an intuitive kind of thing, and I just kept going with it.

209,"In fact, I think that if you really want to know what the future's going to be, if you really want to know about the future, don't ask a technologist, a scientist, a physicist. But that's not what I'm going to talk about. Oh -- the other thing that I think I'd like to talk about is right over here. And I'd love to talk to you about this, but I don't have much in the way of ... things to say because -- (Laughter) (Chris Anderson: I've got a cold.) This guy over here of course is me.

210,"Back in about 2000, I was living in Brooklyn, I was trying to finish my first book, I was wandering around dazed every day because I wrote from 12 a.m. to 5 a.m. So we thought, ""We'll have all these writers and editors and everybody -- sort of a writing community -- coming into the office every day anyway, why don't we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school, get extra help on their written homework, so you have basically no border between these two communities?"" So, we had this place, we rented it, the landlord was all for it. (Laughter) And so this is what we did. The key thing is, even if you only have a couple of hours a month, those two hours shoulder-to-shoulder, next to one student, concentrated attention, shining this beam of light on their work, on their thoughts and their self-expression, is going to be absolutely transformative, because so many of the students have not had that ever before. Then we said, ""Well, what are we going to do with the space during the day, because it has to be used before 2:30 p.m.?"" So this is one of the books that they do. Because what about the students that wouldn't come to you, necessarily, who don't have really active parents that are bringing them in, or aren't close enough?"" What is this?""

So all the people I used to know in Brooklyn, they said, ""Well, why don't we have a place like that here?"" They didn't think that that was going to work there. That was it. It's an addictive thing to sort of be done with it, and to have it checked, and to know he's going to achieve the next thing and be prepared for school the next day.

211,"Let's look for a minute at the greatest icon of all, Leonardo da Vinci. But we do not know his face. Is this the face of Leonardo da Vinci or isn't it? His contemporaries made faces, like the ones you see here -- en face or three-quarters. I think that if we were to scan all of his work and look for self-portraits, we would find his face looking at us. There are about 120, you see them here. And we know from his contemporaries that Leonardo was a very handsome, even beautiful man. And here they are. And lastly, the only portrait of a male that Leonardo painted, ""The Musician."" All we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self-portrait, and look, they are very similar. And as you see here from the years that they were created, it is indeed the case. What was the age of Leonardo at the time? So we have three pictures, potentially of the same person of the same age as Leonardo at the time. And if we now compare the face of the statue, with the face of the musician, you see the very same features again. The statue is the reference, and it connects the identity of Leonardo to those three faces.","If we were to scan all of his work and look for self-portraits, we would find his face looking at us.

212,"Most of this is in developing countries, and the majority is in Africa. What are you going to do? Let me lead you through a day in the life of the Heart Institute, so you get a glimpse of what we do, and I'll talk a little bit more about it. We have every modality that can be done in Vanderbilt, Cleveland Clinic -- everywhere in the U.S. -- and we do it for about 10 percent of the cost that you will need to do those things in the United States. Easy to repair, and because of that, we do not take things that are not durable and cannot last. This is at the Heart Institute. Because if you can't get it in Nashville, you can travel to Birmingham, two hours away, and you'll get it. We don't have that luxury, so we have to make it happen. It's not possible to tell people to do what is going to be expensive, and they go home and can't do it. If you don't get this pacemaker, you will be dead. This is how we can do that. And for that money -- for every one patient that has the money to pay, it gives us an opportunity to take care of at least four people that do not have the resources to pay. I think this aspect of training in cardiology that the Heart Institute of the Caribbean has introduced in Jamaica is very important in terms of diagnosing cardiac diseases.

213,"And that's what I want to talk about today, and how that relates to the emergence of social production. Because for 150 years, we've had an information economy. What this means is that for the first time since the industrial revolution, the most important means, the most important components of the core economic activities -- remember, we are in an information economy -- of the most advanced economies, and there more than anywhere else, are in the hands of the population at large. One was a motley collection of volunteers who just decided, you know, we really need this, we should write one, and what are we going to do with what -- well, we're gonna share it! But the thing to see is that this actually happens throughout the Web. So, NASA, at some point, did an experiment where they took images of Mars that they were mapping, and they said, instead of having three or four fully trained Ph.D.s doing this all the time, let's break it up into small components, put it up on the Web, and see if people, using a very simple interface, will actually spend five minutes here, 10 minutes there, clicking. This is what you'll find out about Barbie. This, on the other hand, is what 60,000 passionate volunteers produce in the Open Directory Project, each one willing to spend an hour or two on something they really care about, to say, this is good. When you think of what is the critical innovation of Google, the critical innovation is outsourcing the one most important thing -- the decision about what's relevant -- to the community of the Web as a whole, doing whatever they want to do: so, page rank. The critical innovation here is instead of our engineers, or our people saying which is the most relevant, we're going to go out and count what you, people out there on the Web, for whatever reason -- vanity, pleasure -- produced links, and tied to each other. But it's not the only one. Instead, what we see are social frameworks for all of the critical things that we use property and contract in the market: information flows to decide what are interesting problems; who's available and good for something; motivation structures -- remember, money isn't always the best motivator. And you see surfers, people who see this happening, and in some sense build it into a supply chain, which is a very curious one. It is about the future of the freedom to be as social beings with each other, and the way information, knowledge and culture will be produced. Because it is in this context that we see a battle over how easy or hard it will be for the industrial information economy to simply go on as it goes, or for the new model of production to begin to develop alongside that industrial model, and change the way we begin to see the world and report what it is that we see.","For the first time since the industrial revolution, the most important components of the core economic activities -- remember, we are in an information economy -- of the most advanced economies are in the hands of the population at large. 60,000 passionate volunteers produce in the Open Directory Project.

214,"And then I'll come back to the beginning, and tell you a little bit more -- hopefully convince you -- that I believe that in today's world, it is really important for business leaders not only to have an idea of what their business is all about, but to have a passion for something that is meaningful. (Laughter) And, as you can imagine, if you can picture this: I was born in a very small village in Mexico, in, unfortunately, very poor surroundings, and my parents did not have a college education. But one of the things that exposed me early to learning, and a tremendous curiosity that was instilled in me as a child, was through a technology which is on the screen -- is a Victrola. And even as a child, he was able to instill in me a lot of curiosity. Now, I don't know how many of you have ever done that with your kids, but if you do, please trust me, it's the most pressure you can put on a child, to say -- (Laughter) -- we trust you that you will always do the right thing. So, when you look at that, we said, well, we would like to, then, enable that a little bit. And a couple of years ago at AMD, we came up with this idea of saying, what if we create this initiative we call 50x15, where we are going to aim, that by the year 2015, half of the world will be connected to the Internet so that people and ideas can get connected. And when we embarked in this initiative, from the very beginning we said it very clearly: this is not a charity. So, there has not been a human-centric approach to addressing this segment of the market, so we really believe it is critical to think of it. What I mean by that, and let me use this example, the country of South Africa, because I was just there, therefore I'm a little bit familiar with some of the challenges they have. But to give you an idea how creative this group of people can be, one of the objectives of the One Laptop per Child is to be able to achieve a 10-hour battery life. I'll tell you that one of the things that I feel is really critical for us in industry, in business, is to be able to be passionate about solving these problems. I really believe that you have to have a passion for it. And then a few years later, I had a child, my first child, and again, my father comes to the hospital, and we're looking at the glass, and see all the children on the other side, and he said, ""I've got to remind you again, that for each generation to do better, you're going to have to be a better father than I was."" But the key is that he instilled in me a passion to really get up every day in the morning and want to do better, to really get up and think that my role in life is not just to be the CEO of a Fortune 500 company.","I was born in a very small village in Mexico, in, unfortunately, very poor surroundings, and my parents did not have a college education.

215,"And then, I also wasn't really shining in a certain area that I wanted to be, and you know, you look at those scores, and it wasn't bad, but it was not certainly predictive that I would one day make my living out of the artful arrangement of words. But actually, there was something quite real in my life that happened when I was about 14. And there's the terrible and dreaded observer effect, in which you're looking for something, and you know, things are happening simultaneously, and you're looking at it in a different way, and you're trying to really look for the about-ness, or what is this story about. Now, what's encapsulated in both these drowning metaphors -- actually, one of them is my mother's interpretation, and it is a famous Chinese saying, because she said it to me: ""save a man from drowning, you are responsible to him for life."" What are we supposed to do? Do we stay in for life, or do we do something else and justify and say, well, my intentions were good, and therefore I cannot be held responsible for all of it? That is the ambiguity in my life that really disturbed me, and led me to write a book called ""Saving Fish From Drowning."" So I decided that I would go to Burma for my own intentions, and still didn't know that if I went there, what the result of that would be, if I wrote a book -- and I just would have to face that later, when the time came. When I look at all these things that are morally ambiguous and uncomfortable, and I consider what my intentions should be, I realize it goes back to this identity question that I had when I was a child -- and why am I here, and what is the meaning of my life, and what is my place in the universe? My mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book, because it seemed I knew things I was not supposed to know. What are things that you get from the universe that you can't really explain? But I do think there's a kind of serendipity, and I do want to know what those elements are, so I can thank them, and also try to find them in my life. And it was a man, a Chinese man, and he was stacking these things, not with glue, not with anything. So I remained with them, and the more I wrote that story, the more I got into those beliefs, and I think that's important for me -- to take on the beliefs, because that is where the story is real, and that is where I'm gonna find the answers to how I feel about certain questions that I have in life. We've come to the end of the talk, and I will reveal what is in the bag, and it is the muse, and it is the things that transform in our lives, that are wonderful and stay with us.","There was something quite real in my life that happened when I was about 14.

220,"In fact, mostly now in other things. And the professional, historical linguists in the U.S. and in Western Europe mostly try to stay away from any long-distance relationships, big groupings, groupings that go back a long time, longer than the familiar families. They don't like that. I don't think it's crank. Does it really lead to a single ancestor some 20, 25,000 years ago? And what if we go back beyond that single ancestor, when there was presumably a competition among many languages? How far back does that go? How many tens of thousands of years does it go back? Chris Anderson: Do you have a hunch or a hope for what the answer to that is? Murray Gell-Mann: Well, I would guess that modern language must be older than the cave paintings and cave engravings and cave sculptures and dance steps in the soft clay in the caves in Western Europe, in the Aurignacian Period some 35,000 years ago, or earlier. I can't believe they did all those things and didn't also have a modern language. So, I would guess that the actual origin goes back at least that far and maybe further. But that doesn't mean that all, or many, or most of today's attested languages couldn't descend perhaps from one that's much younger than that, like say 20,000 years, or something of that kind.

221,"What I'm going to offer you is a recipe, a combination of the two forces that changed the world for good, which is the alliance of compassion and enlightened self-interest. So, what does it mean to get serious about providing hope for the bottom billion? It was that you knew you had to, because, in the late 1940s, country after country in Central Europe was falling into the Soviet bloc, and so you knew you'd no choice. So, what did you do, last time you got serious? That was Marshall aid: we need to do it again. I'm going to take the one that sounds the weakest, the one that's just motherhood and apple pie -- governments, mutual systems of support for governments -- and I'm going to show you one idea in how we could do something to strengthen governance, and I'm going to show you that that is enormously important now. The opportunity we're going to look to is a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billion, and that is the commodity booms. You go up in the short run, but then most societies historically have ended up worse than if they'd had no booms at all. You go up in the short term, and then you go up even more in the long term. And so, what the countries of the bottom billion need is very strong checks and balances. In all the societies of the bottom billion, there are intense struggles to do just that.

(Laughter) He built this machine, and we had a beautiful demonstration of how this thing really works, with these little bits. The first person to really explain that was Thomas Hobbes, who, in 1651, explained how arithmetic and logic are the same thing, and if you want to do artificial thinking and artificial logic, you can do it all with arithmetic. But actually, the machine I'm going to tell you about, the Institute for Advanced Study machine, which is way up there, really should be down there.

They just don't do that in that industry. Now, that number is dwarfed by the number of paper cups we use every day, and that is 40 million cups a day for hot beverages, most of which is coffee. And there's a day's worth of our cups. This is that piece installed in a gallery in New York -- those are my parents looking at the piece. So, I made this image out of Barbie dolls, and so, as you stand back you see this kind of floral pattern, and as you get all the way back, you see 32,000 Barbie dolls, which represents the number of breast augmentation surgeries that are performed in the U.S. each month. And the reason that I do this, it's because I have this fear that we aren't feeling enough as a culture right now. We've lost our sense of outrage, our anger and our grief about what's going on in our culture right now, what's going on in our country, the atrocities that are being committed in our names around the world. And one of the causes of this, I think, is that as each of us attempts to build this new kind of worldview, this holoptical worldview, this holographic image that we're all trying to create in our mind of the interconnection of things: the environmental footprints 1,000 miles away of the things that we buy; the social consequences 10,000 miles away of the daily decisions that we make as consumers. As we try to build this view, and try to educate ourselves about the enormity of our culture, the information that we have to work with is these gigantic numbers: numbers in the millions, in the hundreds of millions, in the billions and now in the trillions. Because my belief is, if we can feel these issues, if we can feel these things more deeply, then they'll matter to us more than they do now. And if there are things that we see that we don't like about our culture, then we have a choice. The degree of integrity that each of us can bring to the surface, to bring to this question, the depth of character that we can summon, as we show up for the question of how do we change -- it's already defining us as individuals and as a nation, and it will continue to do that, on into the future.

226,"And it gives us a new way of thinking about not only what's going on on our planet, but what might be going on elsewhere in the cosmos. So first of all, I'd like to say something about memetics and the theory of memes, and secondly, how this might answer questions about who's out there, if indeed anyone is. What Darwin said was something like this: if you have creatures that vary, and that can't be doubted -- I've been to the Galapagos, and I've measured the size of the beaks and the size of the turtle shells and so on, and so on. (Laughter) And if there is a struggle for life, such that nearly all of these creatures die -- and this can't be doubted, I've read Malthus and I've calculated how long it would take for elephants to cover the whole world if they bred unrestricted, and so on and so on. If there's something that is copied with variation and it's selected, then you must get design appearing out of nowhere. Now, what's this to do with memes? SB: Sink, toilet, yes, these are all memes, they're all memes, but they're sort of useful ones, and then there's this one. (Laughter) What is this all about? So, you get an arms race between the genes which are trying to get the humans to have small economical brains and not waste their time copying all this stuff, and the memes themselves, like the sounds that people made and copied -- in other words, what turned out to be language -- competing to get the brains to get bigger and bigger. So, this is a view of what humans are. We have a new kind of memes now. I've been wondering for a long time, since I've been thinking about memes a lot, is there a difference between the memes that we copy -- the words we speak to each other, the gestures we copy, the human things -- and all these technological things around us? We put the storage of memes out there on a clay tablet, but in order to get true temes and true teme machines, you need to get the variation, the selection and the copying, all done outside of humans. OK, so if we take that equation, why haven't we heard from anybody out there? I have no idea.","SB: It gives us a new way of thinking about not only what's going on on our planet, but what might be going on elsewhere in the cosmos.

227,"(Laughter) So this is a vending machine for crows. (Laughter) And after 10 years of this, my wife said, ""You've got to do this thing you've been talking about, and build the vending machine."" But part of the reason I found this interesting is, I started noticing that we're very aware of all the species that are going extinct on the planet as a result of human habitation expansion, and no one seems to be paying attention to all the species that are actually living; they're surviving. And as I started looking at them, I was finding that they had hyper-adapted. But the story of the vending machine is a little more interesting if you know more about crows. But what was really interesting to me was to find out that the birds were adapting in a pretty unusual way. And since that time, all the crows in the neighborhood are picking up this behavior. So we know that there's lots of crows. This is a vending machine for crows. Then they leave, the machine spits up more coins and peanuts, and life is dandy if you're a crow -- you can come back anytime and get yourself a peanut. So when they get really used to that, we move on to the crows coming back. Now they're used to the sound of the machine; they keep coming back and digging out peanuts from the pile of coins that's there. So they do what they do in nature when they're looking for something: sweep things out of the way with their beak. The crows learn that all they have to do is show up, wait for the coin to come out, put it in the slot, then get their peanut. So, what's significant about this to me isn't that we can train crows to pick up peanuts.","Crows are adapting in a pretty unusual way. This is a vending machine for crows.

228,"And, kind of as a way of surviving, I would go into my own very personal space, and I would make things.

And then it was a matter of starting from one point and sort of building to that final point.

(Applause) This kind of work is also very much like puppetry, where the found object is, in a sense, the puppet, and I'm the puppeteer at first, because I'm playing with an object. And -- so the way I saw this in my mind at first, was that the pieces would explode up and out with infinite speed, and the pieces would move far out, and then they would begin to be pulled back with a kind of a gravitational feel, to the point where they would approach infinite speed back to the center. There are 12 pairs of 50:1 reductions, so that means that the final speed of that gear on the end is so slow that it would take two trillion years to turn once.

And she thought to herself, ""My child just turned two, and until the child turned two, I had always used this complicated, expensive cure, you know, this treatment. So he thought, ""I don't know anything about science, but I do know something about data, so maybe I should go and look at the data and see whether this expensive and complicated treatment actually works any better than the cheap and simple one."" And lo and behold, when he went through the data, he found that it didn't look like the expensive, complicated solution was any better than the cheap one, at least for the children who were two and older -- the cheap one still didn't work on the kids who were younger.

231,"I mean, it was incredible, it worked incredibly well, but it was really dangerous.

It wasn't what I wanted to do. So, all of these projects have a humanistic sense to them, and I think as designers we need to really think about how we can create a different relationship between our work and the world, whether it's for business, or, as I'm going to show, on some civic-type projects. So Jawbone is a project that you're familiar with, and it has a humanistic technology. But the other thing that is humanistic about Jawbone is that we really decided to take out all the techie stuff, and all the nerdy stuff out of it, and try to make it as beautiful as we can. I mean, think about it: the care we take in selecting sunglasses, or jewelry, or accessories is really important, so if it isn't beautiful, it really doesn't belong on your face.

It's a little bit like designing a fire hydrant, and it has to be easily serviceable: you have to know where it is and what it does. It was breaking the ice, it was getting over a stigma, and I think that's also what design can do.

Here's what we do. What we discovered is whether you look at the leg of a human like Richard, or a cockroach, or a crab, or a kangaroo, the relative leg stiffness of that spring is the same for everything we've seen so far. What can they do? It said to us that if you could build a robot with very simple, springy legs, you could make it as maneuverable as any that's ever been built. The animal I'm going to show you, that we studied to look at this, is the gecko. One of the animals is going to be running on the level, and the other one's going to be running up a wall. They do this with their toes. Here's the animal that we have here, running on a vertical surface. First we'll see the animals toes peeling -- look at that. And if you look at the toes, they have these little leaves there, and if you blow them up and zoom in, you'll see that's there's little striations in these leaves. No, you can put them on molecular smooth surfaces -- they don't do it. (Laughter) (Applause) We'll see where this goes. I think you can see it already.","The relative leg stiffness of that spring is the same for everything we've seen so far.

233,"By the time the last Neanderthal disappeared in Europe, 27,000 years ago, our direct ancestors had already, and for 5,000 years, been crawling into the belly of the earth, where in the light of the flickers of tallow candles, they had brought into being the great art of the Upper Paleolithic. We all have children. They said, at one point, you know, we don't really believe you went to the moon, but you did. And if we move from the realm of the spirit to the realm of the physical, to the sacred geography of Peru -- I've always been interested in the relationships of indigenous people that literally believe that the Earth is alive, responsive to all of their aspirations, all of their needs. And the metaphor is clear: you go into the mountain as an individual, but through exhaustion, through sacrifice, you emerge as a community that has once again reaffirmed its sense of place in the planet. All that time, the world only exists as an abstraction, as they are taught the values of their society. Now, the measure of a society is not only what it does, but the quality of its aspirations. I traveled with the Arhuacos, and the wonderful thing about this story was that this man, Danilo Villafane -- if we just jump back here for a second. And I said, ""Danilo, you won't remember this, but when you were an infant, I carried you on my back, up and down the mountains."" And it was extraordinary to be taken by a priest. And of course, this is a photograph literally taken the night we were in hiding, as they divine their route to take us out of the mountains. They cannot understand why it is that we do what we do to the Earth. On the contrary, you know, if you have the heart to feel and the eyes to see, you discover that the world is not flat.

So here's the plan ... inexpensive refrigeration that doesn't use electricity, propane, gas, kerosene or consumables time for some thermodynamics And the story of the Intermittent Absorption Refrigerator] Adam Grosser: So 29 years ago, I had this thermo teacher who talked about absorption and refrigeration, one of those things that stuck in my head, a lot like the Stirling engine: it was cool, but you didn't know what to do with it. This crazy Canadian named Powel Crosley commercialized this thing called the IcyBall, in 1928. It was a really neat idea, and I'll get to why it didn't work, but here's how it works. The ammonia evaporates and it recondenses in the other side. You let it cool to room temperature, and then, as the ammonia reevaporates and combines with the water back on the erstwhile hot side, it creates a powerful cooling effect. So it was a great idea that didn't work at all. They blew up. So the great thing about 2006, there's a lot of really great computational work you can do. We proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong. We brought in a team from the UK -- a lot of great refrigeration people, it turns out, in the UK -- and built a test rig, and proved that, in fact, we could make a low-pressure, nontoxic refrigerator. So this is the way it works. You put it on a cooking fire. It heats up for about 30 minutes, cools for an hour.

So it's in that same sense that we look back in time to understand what the universe is made of. And, as of today, it's made of these things.

242,"So, I'd like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions. But Einstein realized that Newton had left something out of the story, because even Newton had written that although he understood how to calculate the effect of gravity, he'd been unable to figure out how it really works. Now here's the thing: when he wrote down the equations describing warps and curves in a universe with four space dimensions, not three, he found the old equations that Einstein had already derived in three dimensions -- those were for gravity -- but he found one more equation because of the one more dimension. Number one: if there are more dimensions in space, where are they? And the idea that maybe the big dimensions around us are the ones that we can easily see, but there might be additional dimensions curled up, sort of like the circular part of that cable, so small that they have so far remained invisible. Some of you guys will fix that one day, but anything that's not flat on a screen is a new dimension, goes smaller, smaller, smaller, and way down in the microscopic depths of space itself, this is the idea, you could have additional curled up dimensions -- here is a little shape of a circle -- so small that we don't see them. Well, it turns out that Einstein and Kaluza and many others worked on trying to refine this framework and apply it to the physics of the universe as was understood at the time, and, in detail, it didn't work. The idea is like this. Finally, you can study the equations, and show that it works only in a universe that has 10 dimensions of space and one dimension of time. (Laughter) But it raises the question: are we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions, or do they tell us something about the world? And that question is this: when we look around the world, as scientists have done for the last hundred years, there appear to be about 20 numbers that really describe our universe. So when we talk about the extra dimensions in string theory, it's not one extra dimension, as in the older ideas of Kaluza and Klein. This is what string theory says about the extra dimensions. And the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like, then the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us would look like this on the tiniest of scales. And if you watch these little fellows vibrating around -- they'll be there in a second -- right there, notice that they way they vibrate is affected by the geometry of the extra dimensions.","Einstein realized that Newton had left something out of the story, because even Newton had written that although he understood how to calculate the effect of gravity, he'd been unable to figure out how it really works.

244,"One is that, why are some disease organisms more harmful? So, one way you can test is just look at all diarrheal bacteria, and see whether or not the ones that tend to be more transmitted by water, tend to be more harmful. Now I put those names in there just for the bacteria buffs, but the main point here is that -- (Laughter) there's a lot of them here, I can tell -- the main point here is that those data points all show a very strong, positive association between the degree to which a disease organism is transmitted by water, and how harmful they are, how much death they cause per untreated infection. Other countries, in which you've got a lot of waterborne transmission, there you expect these organisms to evolve towards a high level of harmfulness, right? Just to emphasize this, this is what we're really talking about. Now, I don't know how that happened, and I didn't have anything to do with it, I promise you. And to just give you a sense of how important this might be, if we look in 1995, we find that there's only one case of cholera, on average, reported from Chile every two years. They didn't -- they solved the problem in Chile. And I want to give you just one more example, because we've talked a little bit about malaria. And the example I want to deal with is, or the idea I want to deal with, the question is, what can we do to try to get the malarial organism to evolve to mildness? So, if you were to mosquito proof houses, you should be able to get these organisms to evolve to mildness. And so if you do something with those systems, they're going to evolve one way or another. And all I'm saying is that we need to figure out how they'll evolve, so that -- we need to adjust our interventions to get the most bang for the intervention buck, so that we can get these organisms to evolve in the direction we want them to go. So, I don't really have time to talk about those things, but I did want to put them up there, just to give you a sense that there really are solutions to controlling the evolution of harmfulness of some of the nasty pathogens that we're confronted with. If we know that we're going to get extra bang for the buck from providing clean water, then I think that we can say, let's push the effort into that aspect of the control, so that we can actually solve the problem, even though, if you just look at the frequency of infection, you would suggest that you can't solve the problem well enough just by cleaning up water supply.","One is that, why are some disease organisms more harmful?

And what you can see is -- it is actually a very good game. But what you'll see is that all the animations in this game are very repetitive. It also means that games aren't really going to be as surprising as they could be, because you only get out of it, at least in terms of the character, what you actually put into it. Now, the interesting bit is, if I move the obstacle a tiny bit to the right, which is what I'm doing now, here, it will fall over it in a completely different way. What you see here on the screen right now is a very simple visualization of that body. Now, what I'm going to do right now, in a moment, is just push this character a tiny bit and we'll see what happens. So that's what you see here. What this is now is a real simulation. So, here's the same character with the same behavior I've just shown you, but now I'm just going to push it from different directions.

248,"We are the species called Homo sapiens sapiens, and it's important to remember that, in terms of our place in the world today and our future on planet Earth. And that's just a tiny fraction of all species that have ever lived on the planet in past times. And it is important to remember that all of these great apes have come on as long and as interesting evolutionary journey as we ourselves have today. And it's this journey that is of such interest to humanity, and it's this journey that has been the focus of the past three generations of my family, as we've been in East Africa looking for the fossil remains of our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past. I doubt many of you in the audience can see the fossil that's in this picture, but if you look very carefully, there is a jaw, a lower jaw, of a 4.1-million-year-old upright-walking ape as it was found at Lake Turkana on the west side. And these things are so exciting. (Laughter) OK, so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much as we do know today about our ancestors, because it's incredibly difficult, A, for these things to become -- to be -- preserved, and secondly, for them to have been brought back up to the surface. And if you look north here, there's a big river that flows into the lake that's been carrying sediment and preserving the remains of the animals that lived there. Two million years ago at Lake Turkana, Homo erectus, one of our human ancestors, actually lived in this region. (Laughter) But it is not to say that being a single species on planet Earth is the norm. But when I was 12, as I was in this picture, a very exciting expedition was in place on the west side, when they found essentially the skeleton of this Homo erectus. I could relate to this Homo erectus skeleton very well, because I was the same age that he was when he died. But they lived only 18,000 years ago, and that is truly extraordinary to think about. Human ancestors really only survive on planet Earth, if you look at the fossil record, for about, on average, a million years at a time. We have to control our numbers, and I think this is as important as anything else that's being done in the world today.","We are the species called Homo sapiens sapiens, and it's important to remember that, in terms of our place in the world today and our future on planet Earth.

251,"I want to talk about something quite different, which is what I know about, and that is astronomy. Particularly, there's a place called Europa, which is -- Europa is one of the moons of Jupiter, where we see a very level ice surface, which looks as if it's floating on top of an ocean. There is a -- imagine that life originated on Europa, and it was sitting in the ocean for billions of years. It's quite likely that it would move out of the ocean onto the surface, just as it did on the Earth. So they would have to have -- these creatures, which I call sunflowers, which I imagine living on the surface of Europa, would have to have either lenses or mirrors to concentrate sunlight, so they could keep themselves warm on the surface. Of course, it's not very likely that there's life on the surface of Europa. So, the same thing could be true for this kind of life, which I'm talking about, on cold objects: that it could in fact be very abundant all over the universe, and it's not been detected just because we haven't taken the trouble to look. And then, when you shine sunlight at them, the sunlight will be reflected back, just as it is in the eyes of an animal. And the further out you go in this, away from the Sun, the more powerful this reflection will be. But if you breathe air -- (Laughter) -- you're dead -- (Laughter) -- as soon as you're off the planet, unless you have a spaceship. But if you live in a vacuum, if you live on the surface of one of these objects, say, in the Kuiper Belt, this -- an object like Pluto, or one of the smaller objects in the neighborhood of Pluto, and you happened -- if you're living on the surface there, and you get knocked off the surface by a collision, then it doesn't change anything all that much. You still are on a piece of ice, you can still have sunlight and you can still survive while you're traveling from one place to another. So, I hope in the next 10 years, we'll find these creatures, and then, of course, our whole view of life in the universe will change. We can -- as soon as we have a little bit more understanding of genetic engineering, one of the things you can do with your take-it-home, do-it-yourself genetic engineering kit -- (Laughter) -- is to design a creature that can live on a cold satellite, a place like Europa, so we could colonize Europa with our own creatures.

253,"And the third problem about the disease model is, in our rush to do something about people in trouble, in our rush to do something about repairing damage, it never occurred to us to develop interventions to make people happier -- positive interventions. So that was not good. The one way in which they differ: they're extremely social. This is a life in which you have as much positive emotion as you possibly can, and the skills to amplify it. You don't have positive emotion. And this is indeed the characteristic of what we think of as the good life. Just to sample the kind of interventions that we find have an effect: when we teach people about the pleasant life, how to have more pleasure in your life, one of your assignments is to take the mindfulness skills, the savoring skills, and you're assigned to design a beautiful day. Your assignment, when you're learning the gratitude visit, is to write a 300-word testimonial to that person, call them on the phone in Phoenix, ask if you can visit, don't tell them why. It's so heartening to be in a group like this, in which so many of you have turned your lives to philanthropy. Well, my undergraduates and the people I work with haven't discovered this, so we actually have people do something altruistic and do something fun, and contrast it. This is really what you're about.

More recently, because the cost of letting groups communicate with each other has fallen through the floor -- and communication costs are one of the big inputs to coordination -- there has been a second answer, which is to put the cooperation into the infrastructure, to design systems that coordinate the output of the group as a by-product of the operating of the system, without regard to institutional models.

259,"First of all, it was impossible, and it's not what it was. And so one of the things that I think we're learning -- if you think about, like, Wikipedia, it's something that was simply impossible. So, I have a kind of a simple story, and it suggests that what we want to think about is this thing that we're making, this thing that has happened in 5,000 days -- that's all these computers, all these handhelds, all these cell phones, all these laptops, all these servers -- basically what we're getting out of all these connections is we're getting one machine. And that's what we're going to do in the next 5,000 days -- we're going to give this machine a body. The point is that everything will have embedded in it some sensor connecting it to the machine, and so we have, basically, an Internet of things. And if you remember, it was a kind of green screen with cursors, and there was really not much to do, and if you wanted to connect it, you connected it from one computer to another computer. Each time you go into there, you have to tell it again who you are and all your friends are. And all these things that are going to be on this are not just pages, they are things. And so there's actually a fourth thing that we have not get to, that we won't see in the next 10 years, or 5,000 days, but I think that's where we're going to. We're so dependent on this that I have now gotten to the point where I don't even try to remember things -- I'll just Google it. So we are the Web, that's what this thing is. We are going to be the machine. So the single idea that I wanted to leave with you is that we have to begin to think about this as not just ""the Web, only better,"" but a new kind of stage in this development. It's a ""One."" We are in the One.","In 5,000 days, computers, handhelds, cell phones, laptops, all these servers will be connected.

260,"You can talk about creationism -- which I think wouldn't go down well with this audience, at least not from a view where you were a proponent of it -- or you can talk about optimisations, spelled the British way, with an S, instead of a Z. And I think that's what I'd like to talk about today. But any kind of conversation about architecture -- which is, in fact, what you were just talking about, what was going on here, setting up TED, small-scale architecture -- at the present time can't really happen without a conversation about this, the World Trade Center, and what's been going on there, what it means to us. I think that the World Trade Center in, rather an unfortunate way, brought architecture into focus in a way that I don't think people had thought of in a long time, and made it a subject for common conversation. At the point where you can weaponize your buildings, you have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way. And so now we're going to think about architecture in a very different way, we're going to think about it like this. There it is. And so we got this, or we had a choice of that. Now, I don't know what you think, but I think this is a pretty stupid decision, because what you've done is just made a permanent memorial to destruction by making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever. But I want you to think about these things in terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that American architecture represents, and that these two things talk about very specifically. And that is the wild divergence in how we choose our architects, in trying to decide whether we want architecture from the kind of technocratic solution to everything -- that there is a large, technical answer that can solve all problems, be they social, be they physical, be they chemical -- or something that's more of a romantic solution. Why do we all want to do that? Meanwhile, instead of sending someone working drawings, which are those huge sets of blueprints that you've seen your whole life, what the architect can do is send a set of assembly instructions, like you used to get when you were a child, when you bought little models that said, ""Bolt A to B, and C to D."" And so what the builder will get is every single individual part that has been custom manufactured off-site and delivered on a truck to the site, to that builder, and a set of these instruction manuals. And when you go to the beach, what do you get? It's not to create a technological solution, it's to seduce you into something that you can do, into something that will please you, something that will lift your spirits, something that will make you feel as if are in another world -- such as his Nobu restaurant in New York, which is supposed to take you from the clutter of New York City to the simplicity of Japan and the elegance of Japanese tradition.","The World Trade Center brought architecture into focus in a way that I don't think people had thought of in a long time.

262,"In one study of college students, they asked a lot of questions about love, but the two that stood out to me the most were: ""Have you ever been rejected by somebody who you really loved?"" Pain like a boil about to burst with my love for you, consumed by fire with my love for you. I remember what you said to me. I am thinking of your love for me. Remember what I said, my love. We found activity in the brain region, in exactly the same brain region associated with intense romantic love. You know, when you've been dumped, the one thing you love to do is just forget about this human being, and then go on with your life -- but no, you just love them harder. We found activity in other brain regions also -- in a brain region associated with calculating gains and losses. So, what have I learned from this experiment that I would like to tell the world?

And that's about it, that's all they know.

263,"In fact, this dark matter dominates the gravitational effects in the universe on a large scale, and I'll be telling you about the evidence for that. As you can imagine, even if you know physics, this should be intuitive, OK -- that stars that are closer to the mass in the middle will be rotating at a higher speed than those that are further out here, OK. So we see the galaxy and fixate on that, but it's actually a cloud of dark matter that's dominating the structure and the dynamics of this galaxy. And again, what we find is that there is much more mass there than can be accounted for by the galaxies that we see. And suppose there's a galaxy out here in the universe. How do we see that galaxy? We say, the ray of light came this way; the galaxy must be there, OK. Now, suppose I put in the middle a cluster of galaxies -- and don't forget the dark matter, OK. Now, if we consider a different ray of light, one going off like this, we now need to take into account what Einstein predicted when he developed general relativity. And now put the lens over the galaxy, and what you'll find is that you'll see a ring, an Einstein ring. They are centered on some more spread out structure, and that is the dark matter in which the cluster is embedded, OK. So the evidence that we have that a quarter of the universe is dark matter -- this gravitationally attracting stuff -- is that galaxies, the speed with which stars orbiting galaxies is much too large; it must be embedded in dark matter. And it's not because galaxies are moving away from each other through space. Now, so at this point, then, what I want to really emphasize to you, is that, first of all, dark matter and dark energy are completely different things, OK. Now, we look for these dark matter particles because, after all, they are here in the room, OK, and they didn't come in the door. There's going to be a satellite telescope launched later this year and it will look towards the middle of the galaxy, to see if we can see dark matter particles annihilating and producing gamma rays that could be detected with this.

265,"And so, the question is, why aren't we really seeing this kind of power in computers that we see in the brain? How is the brain able to do this? Let's just take a look about how the brain works, and then I'll compare that with how computers work. And that's basically what's going on in your brain right now as you're watching this. In the computer, you have all the data going through the central processing unit, and any piece of data basically has to go through that bottleneck, whereas in the brain, what you have is these neurons, and the data just really flows through a network of connections among the neurons. And then the way that you process that data to get a result is that you translate this pattern of activity into a new pattern of activity, just by it flowing through the network. What you see here is that there's these redundant connections. So even when you go to these crappy devices where sometimes you want a one and you get a zero, and it doesn't show up, there's redundancy in the network that can actually recover the missing information. They want to compress the information -- they just want to send the changes, what's new in the image, and so on -- and that is how your eyeball is able to squeeze all that information down to your optic nerve, to send to the rest of the brain. And the chip -- I'm going to show you a video that the silicon retina put out of its output when it was looking at Kareem Zaghloul, who's the student who designed this chip. And this is the same thing you see when people compress video to send: they want to make it very sparse, because that file is smaller. And this is what the retina is doing, and it's doing it just with the circuitry, and how this network of neurons that are interacting in there, which we've captured on the chip. So this image here is going to look like these ones, but here I'll show you that we can reconstruct the image, so, you know, you can almost recognize Kareem in that top part there. And what I would like us to do is put Africa in the computer, and come up with a new kind of computer that will generate thought, imagination, be creative and things like that.

Now, here's how you do the battery and the bulb. But if you haven't played with a battery and a bulb, if you've only seen a circuit diagram, you might not be able to do that, and that's one of the problems. I mean, it's a very strange thing going on, and we hold these two models in our head, of what's right and what isn't right, and we do that, as human beings, in all sorts of fields. We do this, of course, with matters of race, and politics, and everything else, and we do it in science as well. And that you don't -- there's no passion in it, and it's not hands on, right, and, you know, pun intended.

269,"And I would like to make a case to you that over the years since we first developed atomic weaponry, until this very moment, we've actually lived in a dangerous nuclear world that's characterized by two phases, which I'm going to go through with you right now. But I want to just point out to you that 95 percent of the nuclear weapons at any particular time since 1985 -- going forward, of course -- were part of the arsenals of the United States and the Soviet Union. They could be ""re-commissioned,"" but the way they count things, which is very complicated, we think we have about a third of the nuclear weapons we had before.

My point now, though, is that there is a lot that we could do for you who are in here, if you've survived the initial blast. If you find yourself alive, but you're in the vicinity of a nuclear weapon, you have -- that's gone off -- you have 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the size and exactly where it went off, to get out of the way before a lethal amount of radiation comes straight down from the mushroom cloud that goes up. If you can't get out of there, we want you to go into a shelter and stay there. And if you do that, you actually can survive a nuclear blast. So here's what you do.

270,"What is origami? And where it has led in origami is to things like this. And I want to tell you how we did that in origami. So in origami, to obey these laws, we can take simple patterns -- like this repeating pattern of folds, called textures -- and by itself it's nothing. But if we follow the laws of origami, we can put these patterns into another fold that itself might be something very, very simple, but when we put it together, we get something a little different. And if you don't want to fold 400 scales, you can back off and just do a few things, and add plates to the back of a turtle, or toes. We take an idea, combine it with a square, and you get an origami figure. And then once I have that folded shape that we call the base, you can make the legs narrower, you can bend them, you can turn it into the finished shape. And I'm going to show you all how to do that so you can go out of here and fold something. Well, if I unfold it and go back to the crease pattern, you can see that the upper left corner of that shape is the paper that went into the flap. What if I want to make something that has a lot of flaps? It does the circle packing, calculates the crease pattern, and if you use that stick figure that I just showed -- which you can kind of tell, it's a deer, it's got antlers -- you'll get this crease pattern. And if you take this crease pattern, you fold on the dotted lines, you'll get a base that you can then shape into a deer, with exactly the crease pattern that you wanted. So now people can say, ""I want exactly this and this and this,"" and you can go out and fold it. It's a very simple pattern -- you wouldn't even call that origami.","In origami, we can take simple patterns -- like this repeating pattern of folds, called textures -- and by itself it's nothing.

What's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these 24 villages, instead of looking on us as a bunch of white people coming to study a whole bunch of monkeys -- and by the way, many of the staff are now Tanzanian -- but when we began the TACARE program, it was a Tanzanian team going into the villages. And when you get large numbers of people living in land that is not that fertile, particularly when you cut down trees, and you leave the soil open to the wind for erosion, as desperate populations cut down more and more trees, so that they can try and grow food for themselves and their families, what's going to happen?

273,"I'm a librarian, and what I'm trying to do is bring all of the works of knowledge to as many people as want to read it. But with the industriousness of the Egyptians, they were able to build the Library of Alexandria -- the idea of a copy of every book of all the peoples of the world. The problem was you actually had to go to Alexandria to go to it. And the way I'm going to try to do this is do it like the Amazon.com website, the books, music, video and just go step -- media type by media type, just go and say, all right, how're we doing on this? If you wanted to put all of the published works online so that anybody could have it available, well, how big a problem is it? What we found out of this is we didn't have the right books. So the books were in the library. And we have a quick hack that we did to try to put one of our books on it, and it turns out that 200 dots per inch means that you can put scanned books on them that look really good. This is not a fax, this is -- the idea is to do a beautiful job as you're going through these libraries. We actually have been able to do a pretty good job of this, at getting 10 cents a page.

274,"So this is a computer program. And if you buy all of this, and you think life is about computation, as I do, then you look at big questions through the eyes of a computer scientist. When you look at DNA origami, you can see that what it really is, even though you think it's complicated, is a bunch of double helices that are parallel to each other, and they're held together by places where short strands go along one helix and then jump to another one. What is it? Now, this is just a single switch and you need half a billion for a computer, so we have a long way to go. You zoom in, there are just four DNA strands and they have little single-stranded bits on them that can bind to other tiles, if they match. And the point of this, if you didn't catch that, is that tiles are a kind of molecular program and they can output patterns. You can encode the number 32 in the right-hand side of a DNA origami, and when you add those tiles that count, they will start to count -- they will read that 32 and they'll stop at 32. So, what we've done is we've figured out a way to have a molecular program know when to stop going. Here's the DNA origami, and what we can do is we can write 32 on both edges of the DNA origami, and we can now use our watering can and water with tiles, and we can start growing tiles off of that and create a square. If we wanted to make a square of size 10, 100 or 1,000, if we used DNA origami alone, we would require a number of DNA strands that's the square of the size of that square; so we'd need 100, 10,000 or a million DNA strands. But if we use a little computation -- we use origami, plus some tiles that count -- then we can get away with using 100, 200 or 300 DNA strands. If you look at the square that you build with the origami and some counters growing off it, the pattern that it has is exactly the pattern that you need to make a memory. (Laughter) So, it turns out we actually had this idea nine years ago, and that's about the time constant for how long it takes to do these kinds of things, so I think we made a lot of progress. You know, so this is all very cool, but what I'd like you to take from the talk, hopefully from some of those big questions, is that this molecular programming isn't just about making gadgets.","When you look at DNA origami, you can see that what it really is is a bunch of double helices that are parallel to each other, and they're held together by places where short strands go along one helix and then jump to another one.

278,"But what happened was that when I administered a questionnaire to each of these schools, with one single question for the teachers -- which was, ""Would you like to move to an urban, metropolitan area?"" When you take education and technology, then I find in the literature that, you know, things like websites, collaborative environments -- you've been listening to all that in the morning -- it's always piloted first in the best schools, the best urban schools, and, according to me, biases the result. If you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools, where the score was 30 percent, and, let's say, took that up to 40 percent -- that will be a completely different thing. I'm going to talk about children and self-organization, and a set of experiments which sort of led to this idea of what might an alternative education be like. They cut a hole inside that wall -- which is how it has got the name hole-in-the-wall -- and put a pretty powerful PC into that hole, sort of embedded into the wall so that its monitor was sticking out at the other end, a touchpad similarly embedded into the wall, put it on high-speed Internet, put the Internet Explorer there, put it on Altavista.com -- in those days -- and just left it there.

284,"I'm here to talk to you about the importance of praise, admiration and thank you, and having it be specific and genuine. And the way I got interested in this was, I noticed in myself, when I was growing up, and until about a few years ago, that I would want to say thank you to someone, I would want to praise them, I would want to take in their praise of me and I'd just stop it. So my question is, why don't we ask for the things that we need? I know a gentleman, married for 25 years, who's longing to hear his wife say, ""Thank you for being the breadwinner, so I can stay home with the kids,"" but won't ask. She, once a week, meets with her husband and says, ""I'd really like you to thank me for all these things I did in the house and with the kids."" And she said, ""Why wouldn't I thank it, even though they're supposed to do it?"" So, the question is, why was I blocking it? And it's because I'm giving you critical data about me. I'm telling you where I need your help. The guy said, ""You know, when you true the wheels, it's going to make the bike so much better."" I get the same bike back, and they've taken all the little warps out of those same wheels I've had for two and a half years, and my bike is like new. I want you to true your wheels: be honest about the praise that you need to hear. What do you need to hear? Go home to your wife -- go ask her, what does she need? And I want to thank all of you in the audience for being great husbands, great mothers, friends, daughters, sons.","I noticed in myself, when I was growing up, that I would want to say thank you to someone.

285,"Part of the problem, I think, is we stand at the beach, or we see images like this of the ocean, and you look out at this great big blue expanse, and it's shimmering and it's moving and there's waves and there's surf and there's tides, but you have no idea for what lies in there. They're going up and down. Bill Lange: We tend to forget about the fact that the ocean is miles deep on average, and that we're real familiar with the animals that are in the first 200 or 300 feet, but we're not familiar with what exists from there all the way down to the bottom. And you can sit in a room like this, with a joystick and a headset, and drive a robot like that around the bottom of the ocean in real time. And then we had some hint that these things existed all along the axis of it, because if you've got volcanism, water's going to get down from the sea into cracks in the sea floor, come in contact with magma, and come shooting out hot. BL: The white material is a type of bacteria that thrives at 180 degrees C. DG: I think that's one of the greatest stories right now that we're seeing from the bottom of the sea, is that the first thing we see coming out of the sea floor after a volcanic eruption is bacteria. DG: You can see, here's a crab that lives down there. Here they go. What they're getting at is that -- on the back of this crab -- the foodstuff here is this very strange bacteria that lives on the backs of all these animals. And what these shrimp are trying to do is actually harvest the bacteria from the backs of these animals. You see the hot water over here, here and here, coming out. DG: All this stuff is happening along that 40,000-mile long mountain range that we're calling the ribbon of life, because just even today, as we speak, there's life being generated there from volcanic activity. Here's crabs here, worms here. It's not a disaster, it's rhythmic. So, what we've got to learn now is to find out where this planet's going at all these different scales and work with it.","The ocean is miles deep on average, and that we're real familiar with the animals that are in the first 200 or 300 feet.

286,"If you ask people about what part of psychology do they think is hard, and you say, ""Well, what about thinking and emotions?"" And I think the only way to avoid it is to have some horrible visible disease, and then you don't have to explain. And then, of course, you have to do something about how to moderate that, so that anybody can -- so they'll listen to you. If you had 100 million people properly spread out, then if there's some garbage, you throw it away, preferably where you can't see it, and it will rot. So if you make them this big, by using nanotechnology, I suppose -- (Laughter) -- then you could have a thousand times as many. A person comes out, they live for a thousand years doing whatever they do, and then, when it's time to go back for a billion years -- or a million, I forget, the numbers don't matter -- but there really aren't very many people on Earth at a time. I think the big problem is that we're not smart enough to understand which of the problems we're facing are good enough. Well, what are we going to do about that? And as I said, we don't know how hard that is. So this is something that people will be discussing and lots of ethicists -- you know, an ethicist is somebody who sees something wrong with whatever you have in mind. If we do have longevity, then we'll have to face the population growth problem anyway. Nobody knows how most of them work in detail, but we do know that there're lots of different things in there. And I guess I better skip all the rest of this, which are some details on how we might make those smart machines and -- (Laughter) -- and the main idea is in fact that the core of a really smart machine is one that recognizes that a certain kind of problem is facing you. Saying, not what are the situations, but what are the kinds of problems and what are the kinds of strategies, how do you learn them, how do you connect them up, how does a really creative person invent a new way of thinking out of the available resources and so forth. So, I think in the next 20 years, if we can get rid of all of the traditional approaches to artificial intelligence, like neural nets and genetic algorithms and rule-based systems, and just turn our sights a little bit higher to say, can we make a system that can use all those things for the right kind of problem?","If you had 100 million people properly spread out, then if there's some garbage, you throw it away, preferably where you can't see it, and it will rot.

287,"The famous ones -- despotism is a good one; anarchy is a way to not deploy the power in any organized way, to do it in a radically diffused fashion; and democracy is a set of technologies, which have the effect of, in principle, diffusing the power source to a large number of people and then re-concentrating it in a smaller group of people who govern, and who themselves are, in principle, authorized to govern by virtue of what the broader public has done. I don't want to suggest that they are a single thing that you can point to. You can show a mosque, or you can show worshippers, but there's not a straightforward way of depicting Islam. It follows from that that all of the people in the world who say that they are Muslims can, in principle, subscribe to a wide range of different interpretations of what Islam really is, and the same is true of democracy. Fear is not an implausible reaction with a war just around the corner and with a very, very high likelihood that many, many people are going to die as a consequence of this confrontation -- a confrontation which many, many people in the Muslim world do not want, many, many people in the American democracy do not want, many people elsewhere in the world do not want, but which nonetheless is favored by a large enough number of people -- at least in the relevant space, which is the United States -- to actually go forward. Well, all over the Muslim world there are people who take Islam deeply seriously, people who care about Islam, for whom it's a source either of faith, or of civilization, or of deep values, or just a source of powerful personal identity, who think and are saying loudly that Islam and democracy are in fact not in conflict, but are in fact deeply compatible. But now that the Cold War is over, there's nearly universal consensus in the Muslim world -- and pretty close to the same here in the United States, if you talk to people and ask them -- that in principle, there's no reason that democracy and Islam cannot co-exist. I'm here to tell you that many, many Muslims believe -- the vast majority, in fact -- in fact I think I would go so far as to say that many Muslims in Saudi Arabia believe that the core values of Islam, namely acknowledgement of God's sovereignty and basic human equality before God, are themselves compatible with liberty, equality and free political choice. Now what I want to suggest to you is that the reason for hope in this case is that we are on the edge of a real transformation in the Muslim world. And that's a transformation in which many sincerely believing Muslims -- who care very, very deeply about their traditions, who do not want to compromise those values -- believe, through the malleability of the technology of democracy and the malleability and synthetic capability of the technology of Islam, that these two ideas can work together. It will also not look exactly the way either the people in this room, or Muslims out in the rest of the world -- I don't mean to imply there aren't Muslims here, there probably are -- conceptualize Islam. Now, I began with the war because it's the elephant in the room, and you can't pretend that there isn't about to be a war if you're talking about these issues. The war has tremendous risks for the model that I'm describing because it's very possible that as a consequence of a war, many Muslims will conclude that the United States is not the kind of place that they want to emulate with respect to its forms of political government. On the other hand, the capacities for positive results in the aftermath of a war are also not to be underestimated, even by, and I would say especially by, people who are deeply skeptical about whether we should go to war in the first place. And I think that we are capable of taking on that obligation, but only if we put what we can into it.","Democracy is a set of technologies which have the effect of diffusing the power source to a large number of people.

288,"So that's really what this is all about. If I had one here and ripped it open, and that pile I would have on the floor is what we consume and feed our children every year because of what goes into our food supply, because of the way we consume produce in America. We really are what we eat. You know, we have to change the way we teach kids about these things. I get up at 4 a.m. every day and go cook the food for the kids, because this is what we need to do. Now you've probably garnered that I don't love the USDA, and I don't have any idea what to do with their pyramid, this upside-down pyramid with a rainbow over the top, I don't know. You know, we have to change it. You know, the things that we maybe do at home and think are so important, we have to teach kids about in school. And if we're going to change it, and change how we feed kids, we really have to rethink that. You know, if you have kids coming into lunch and all they're going to do when they get out of lunch is go to have recess, you see them just throw away their lunch so they can run outside. I think if we're going to fix this, one of the things we have to do is really change how we have oversight over the National School Lunch Program. Okay, Finance 101 on this, and this -- I'm sort of wrapping it up with this finance piece, because I think this is something we all have to understand. So you know what, when we talk about needing 8 billion more, it's not a lot. That means we spend less than a dollar a day on food for kids in schools -- most schools, 80 to 90 cents.

289,"A year ago, I spoke to you about a book that I was just in the process of completing, that has come out in the interim, and I would like to talk to you today about some of the controversies that that book inspired. There are a number of reasons to doubt that the human mind is a blank slate, and some of them just come from common sense. As many people have told me over the years, anyone who's had more than one child knows that kids come into the world with certain temperaments and talents; it doesn't all come from the outside. There are also, I think, increasing results from the scientific study of humans that, indeed, we're not born blank slates. If you've ever taken anthropology, you know that it's a -- kind of an occupational pleasure of anthropologists to show how exotic other cultures can be, and that there are places out there where, supposedly, everything is the opposite to the way it is here. And here's what happens if you get a pair of people who share all their DNA -- namely, clones or identical twins. They are: the arts and parenting. I'll give you a couple of representative quotes: ""We can assert with some confidence that our own period is one of decline, that the standards of culture are lower than they were 50 years ago, and that the evidences of this decline are visible in every department of human activity."" Well, in fact, the arts are not in decline. And here's just one example. Well, the argument in ""The Blank Slate"" was that elite art and criticism in the 20th century, although not the arts in general, have disdained beauty, pleasure, clarity, insight and style. They're useless because they don't control for heritability. You might think, well, then they'd be even more similar, because not only would they share their genes, but they would also share their environment. What it suggests is that children are shaped not by their parents over the long run, but in part -- only in part -- by their genes, in part by their culture -- the culture of the country at large and the children's own culture, namely their peer group -- as we heard from Jill Sobule earlier today, that's what kids care about -- and, to a very large extent, larger than most people are prepared to acknowledge, by chance: chance events in the wiring of the brain in utero; chance events as you live your life. And I think that the argument can't be put any more eloquently than that.","A year ago, I spoke to you about a book that I was just in the process of completing.

298,"The thing that all the work has in common is that it challenges the assumptions about conventions of space. So, all the waters of the world are served there, so we thought that, you know, after being at the water and moving through the water and breathing the water, you could also drink this building. In 2003, the Whitney mounted a retrospective of our work that featured a lot of this work from the '80s and '90s. And one of the recurring themes, by the way, that in the work was a kind of hostility toward the museum itself, and asking about the conventions of the museum, like the wall, the white wall. We used the wall to partition the 13 installations of the project and produce a kind of acoustic and visual separation. So, you come in and you're basically squeezed by the theater, by the belly of the theater, into this very compressed space where the view is turned off. And then, this is a view going up, and then you could come into the theater, which can actually deny the view or open it up and become a backdrop. So, it's already sticking out into space enough, and then from that is this, is this small area called the Mediatheque. And this was really a kind of very important part of this building, and here is a point where architecture -- this is like technology-free -- architecture is only a framing device, it only edits the harbor view, the industrial harbor just through its walls, its floors and its ceiling, to only expose the water itself, the texture of water, much like a hypnotic effect created by electronic snow or a lava lamp or something like that. And here is where we really felt that there was a great convergence of the technological and the natural in the project. So, this is the entrance to Tully Hall as it used to be, before the renovation, which we just started. But what I wanted to do was take a couple of seconds that I have left to just talk about the hall itself, which is kind of where we're really doing a massive amount of work. So it's a very, very thin architecture. So now that we've stripped the hall of all visual distraction, everything that prevents this intimacy which is supposed to connect the house, the audience, with the performers, we add one little detail, one piece of architectural excess, a special effect: lighting. (Laughter) And for us, I mean it's really kind of a very strange thing, but the moments in the hall that the buzz kind of dies down when the audience is waiting for the performance to begin, very similar to the parting of curtains or the raising of a chandelier, the walls will just exude this glow, temporarily stealing attention from the stage.","The Whitney mounted a retrospective of our work that featured a lot of this work from the '80s and '90s.

Also, while we were at the table, there was a ritual in our family: when something significant had happened for any one of us -- whether mom had just been elected as the president of the PTA, or whether dad had gotten an assignment at the college of our denomination, or whether someone had won the jabberwocky contest for talent -- the ritual at the family was, once the announcement is made, we must take five, ten minutes to do what we call ""make over"" that person -- that is, to make a fuss over the one who had been honored in some way.

301,"(Laughter) And one of the thoughts that I had dealing with these two separate emergences of a book and a baby, and having this event happen so close -- that my first thought, when I was still kind of in the apartment looking out at it all or walking out on the street and looking out on it just in front of our building, was that I'd made a terrible miscalculation in the book that I'd just written. And so I started to think, well, you know, density, density -- I'm not sure if, you know, this was the right call. And this is increasingly what we're starting to see on the Web in a bunch of interesting ways -- most of which weren't around, actually, except in very experimental things, when I was writing ""Emergence"" and when the book came out. That is -- you know, there's no sentence that kind of conjures up that period better than that, I think, which is that you suddenly have the power to put up a picture of your dog and link to it, and somebody reading the page has the power to click on that link or not click on that link. That, in a sense -- to reference what Jeff was talking about yesterday -- that was, in a sense, the kind of interface electricity that powered a lot of the explosion of interest in the Web: that you could put up a link, and somebody could click on it, and it could take you anywhere you wanted to go. Because effectively, what's happening here, what's creating this page, obviously -- and we all know this, but it's worth just thinking about it -- is not some person deciding that I am the number one answer for Steven Johnson, but rather somehow the entire web of people putting up pages and deciding to link to my page or not link to it, and Google just sitting there and running the numbers. He has this line where he says, you know, you're going to put up a link there, if you see a link, somebody decided to put it there. Now, what you're having here is basically a global brain that you're able to do lots of kind of experiments on to see what it's thinking. (Laughter) I also did -- and I don't want to start a little fight in the next panel -- but I did a Google Share analysis of evolution and natural selection. But what's interesting is you can then broaden the search and actually see interesting things and get a sense of what else is out there. (Laughter) Now, there's one way to interpret this, which is to say that ""emancipation"" and ""depression"" and ""recovery"" all have a lot of syllables. You know, 20 years before it was still, ""Ask not what you can do,"" but with Reagan, it's, ""that's where, there's Nancy and I,"" that kind of language. The question now -- and this is the really interesting question -- is, what kind of higher-level shape is emerging right now in the overall Web ecosystem -- and particularly in the ecosystem of the blogs because they are really kind of at the cutting edge. Now this is a very interesting thing. And so very quickly you can accumulate a bunch of links, and it makes it more likely for newcomers to link to you in the future, and then you get this kind of shape.","The Web has given people the power to post pictures of their dogs, and have people click on them.

He has been orphaned, as both of his parents died of AIDS, and his grandmother took care of him until he too died of AIDS.

When she got up to make tea, she placed him in my own lap and I had never felt a child that was that emaciated.

303,"So why didn't the Greenland Norse as well? And then finally, the fifth item on my checklist is the political, economic, social and cultural factors in the society that make it more or less likely that the society will perceive and solve its environmental problems. In the case of the Greenland Norse, cultural factors that made it difficult for them to solve their problems were: their commitments to a Christian society investing heavily in cathedrals; their being a competitive-ranked chiefly society; and their scorn for the Inuit, from whom they refused to learn. What about a society today? So, I'm looking at these issues of collapses for a lot of past societies and for many present societies. There are many societies that don't wind down gradually, but they build up -- get richer and more powerful -- and then within a short time, within a few decades after their peak, they collapse. A second general theme is that there are many, often subtle environmental factors that make some societies more fragile than others. And within the last couple of years, it's been obvious that the elite in the business world correctly perceive that they can advance their short-term interest by doing things that are good for them but bad for society as a whole, such as draining a few billion dollars out of Enron and other businesses. So, that's one general conclusion about why societies make bad decisions: conflicts of interest. And the other generalization that I want to mention is that it's particularly hard for a society to make quote-unquote good decisions when there is a conflict involving strongly held values that are good in many circumstances but are poor in other circumstances. Well, all of us know the dozen sorts of ticking time bombs going on in the modern world, time bombs that have fuses of a few decades to -- all of them, not more than 50 years, and any one of which can do us in; the time bombs of water, of soil, of climate change, invasive species, the photosynthetic ceiling, population problems, toxics, etc., etc. Instead, there are a dozen things, any one of which could do us in. And we've got to get them all right, because if we solve 11, we fail to solve the 12th -- we're in trouble. For example, if we solve our problems of water and soil and population, but don't solve our problems of toxics, then we are in trouble. And there's a lot that we already do understand, but aren't doing, and that we need to be doing.","So why didn't the Greenland Norse as well?

304,"I love doing this work, because it really gives many people new hope and new choices that they didn't have before, and it allows us to talk about things that -- not just diet, but that happiness is not -- we're talking about the pursuit of happiness, but when you really look at all the spiritual traditions, what Aldous Huxley called the ""perennial wisdom,"" when you get past the names and forms and rituals that divide people, it's really about -- our nature is to be happy; our nature is to be peaceful, our nature is to be healthy. And so happiness is not something you get, health is generally not something that you get, but rather, all of these different practices -- you know, the ancient swamis and rabbis and priests and monks and nuns didn't develop these techniques to just manage stress or lower your blood pressure or unclog your arteries, even though it can do all those things. And it's not a diet. When I began doing this work 26 or 27 years ago, it was thought that once you have heart disease, it can only get worse. But it's really not natural; we found it could get better and better, and much more quickly than people thought. We also found the more people changed, the better they got. And what we found was that 99 percent of the patients stopped or reversed the progression of their heart disease. And telling people they're going to die is too scary to think about, or that they'll get emphysema or a heart attack is too scary, and they don't want to think about it, so they don't. And the paradox is that when you make big changes, you get big benefits, and you feel so much better so quickly. These are not election returns; these are the percentage of people who are overweight. Just as all carbs are not bad for you, all fats are not bad; there are good fats. You want to do it in a way that enhances your health, not one that harms it. The problem is, it's based on this half-truth: Americans eat too many simple carbs, so if you eat fewer, you'll lose weight, and even more weight if you eat whole foods and less fat, and you'll enhance your health rather than harming it. And then, again, it's a spectrum: when you move in this direction, you're going to lose weight, you'll feel better, and you'll gain health. The last thing I want to talk about, apropos of the issue of the pursuit of happiness, is that study after study has shown that people who are lonely and depressed -- and depression is the other real epidemic in our culture -- are many times more likely to get sick and die prematurely, in part because, as we talked about, they're more likely to smoke, overeat, drink too much, work too hard, and so on.","I love doing this work, because it really gives many people new hope and new choices that they didn't have before.

305,"You have to, of course, be aware of the needs of others, but you have to be aware in such a way that you can carry on with your life and be of help to people. You know, there's no way that you can do anything for anyone if you overdo things. This idea of compassion comes to us because we're made in the image of God, who is ultimately the compassionate one. So there is a connectivity, and I have to understand that -- as part of the creation, as part of me being made in the image of God. So, in a sense, the 18 minutes is challenging me to say, ""In life, this is what's important in terms of compassion."" Now there is, in Judaism, a gorgeous story of a rich man who sat in synagogue one day. He said, ""God wants bread. That's it. And after the Sabbath, he made 12 loaves of bread, took them to the synagogue, went into the synagogue, opened the ark and said, ""God, I don't know why you want this bread, but here you are."" And he put it in the ark with the scrolls of the Torah. Every week, the man would bring bread with raisins, with all sorts of good things, put it into the ark. ""Of course, what you are doing,"" he said to the rich man, ""is answering God's plea that we should be compassionate. So that is the way I feel: that I can only try to approach this notion of being compassionate, of understanding that there is a connectivity, that there is a unity in this world; that I want to try and serve that unity, and that I can try and do that by understanding, I hope, trying to understand something of the pain of others; but understanding that there are limits, that people have to bear responsibility for some of the problems that come upon them; and that I have to understand that there are limits to my energy, to the giving I can give. And then I have to try to see in what ways I can make these the hands of God.

306,"Actually, for the next 18 minutes I'm going to do the best I can to describe the beauty of particle physics without equations. (Laughter) In this setup, SchrÃ¶dinger is in a box with a radioactive sample that, by the laws of quantum mechanics, branches into a state in which it is radiated and a state in which it is not. This seems weird to us, because each of us only experiences an individual existence, and we don't get to see other branches. It's as if each of us, like SchrÃ¶dinger here, are a kind of coral branching into different possibilities. If we spread out the hypercharge and weak charge and plot the charges of particles in this two-dimensional charge space, the electric charge is where these particles sit along the vertical direction. The charges of all known particles can be plotted in a four-dimensional charge space, and projected down to two dimensions like this so we can see them. So there's an old idea in particle physics that this known pattern of charges, which is not very symmetric, could emerge from a more perfect pattern that gets broken -- similar to how the Higgs particle breaks the electroweak pattern to give electromagnetism. It's a very beautiful object, and as with any unification, we can see some holes where new particles are required by this pattern. From their location in this pattern, we know that these new particles should be scalar fields like the Higgs particle, but have color charge and interact with the strong force. And this idea that nature is described by mathematics is not at all new. (Laughter) Now, how bad would that be? (Laughter) This way, even if the physics I work on comes to nothing, I still know I've lived a good life. GL: Well, right now the pattern I showed you that corresponds to what we know about elementary particle physics -- that already corresponds to a very beautiful shape. And that would be what explains all these elementary particles that we see. And -- in this way, the way that E8 comes in is it will be as a shape that's attached at each point in the space-time.","In this setup, SchrÃ¶dinger is in a box with a radioactive sample that, by the laws of quantum mechanics, branches into a state in which it is radiated.

307,"As the child grows to become an adult: so far, it has been a consumer, but the growth of a human being lies in his or her capacity to contribute, to be a contributor. You can be compassionate occasionally, more moved by empathy than by compassion. No culture, no nation and nationalism -- nothing can touch it because it is empathy. The subject -- ""me"" -- and the object -- the scheme of things -- fuse into oneness, an experience nobody can say, ""I am denied of,"" an experience common to all and sundry. But the extension of the logic is that you don't need to fulfill your desire to be happy. There's no choice in this: that only confirms the reality that the wholeness cannot be different from you, cannot be minus you. It has got to be you. You cannot be a part of wholeness and still be whole. Your moment of happiness reveals that reality, that realization, that recognition: ""Maybe I am the whole. But if I say, in spite of my body being limited -- if it is black it is not white, if it is white it is not black: body is limited any which way you look at it. And the wholeness is the reality of you when you relate to the world. When you relate to the world, the dynamic manifestation of the wholeness is, what we say, love. (Laughter) And, therefore, what I say, you have to fake it and make it. But then, how to act compassionately if you don't have compassion?

Boy: Oh, Marcus, you know what I mean. Which takes us to the next piece, where the young man talks about lack of opportunity: living as a black person in Europe, the glass ceiling that we all know about, that we all talk about, and his reality. Again, this was my -- this was me talking about -- this was, again, the time of multiculturalism in the United Kingdom, and there was this buzzword -- and it was trying to say, what exactly does this multiculturalism mean in the real lives of people?

And then they stopped, and the man turned to me and said, ""What are you looking for, flying saucers?"" But what was stranger still -- and even I realized it at the time, as a nine-year-old child -- was that they stopped at all. I went to see the movie ""Dune,"" and a girl talked to me.

312,"But what we're going to talk about today is really design. Really good designers are like sponges: they really are curious and absorb every kind of information that comes their way, and transform it so that it can be used by people like us. And what I'm going to do today is I'm going to give you a preview of the next exhibition that I'm working on, which is called ""Design and the Elastic Mind."" And this is what this exhibition looks at. We all know it, and we do it kind of automatically. And this exhibition is about the work of designers that help us be more elastic, and also of designers that really work on this elasticity as an opportunity. And one last thing is that it's not only designers, but it's also scientists. And it was great, because at the beginning was this apology fest -- you know, scientists would tell designers, you know, I don't know what style is, I'm not really elegant. The exhibition will talk about the work of both designers and scientists, and show how they're presenting the possibilities of the future to us. This is the work of design students from the Royal College of Arts in London that have been working together with their tutor, Tony Dunne, and with a bunch of scientists around Great Britain on the possibilities of nanotechnology for design in the future. So you go, even in the exhibition, from the idea of nanotechnology and the nanoscale to the manipulation of really great amounts of data -- the mapping and tagging of the universe and of the world. Another aspect of contemporary design that I think is mind-opening, promising and will really be the future of design, is the idea of collective design. The idea is that it's become so difficult to have a private conversation anywhere that you go to the spa, you have a massage, you have a facial, maybe a rub, and then you have this beautiful pool with this perfect temperature, and you can have this isolation tank phone conversation with whomever you've been wanting to talk with for a long time.

313,"But I found that on the -- I read in the newspapers that there was to be a presentation by someone in a place that I'd seen in the center of Zurich, and it was about flying saucers [that] he was going to talk. And it's interesting, if you think about it, how, when we think about the civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement -- whether it's China, Greece, the Hindu civilization, or the Mayas, or Egyptians -- what we know about them is really about their ecstasies, not about their everyday life. Now, this man doesn't need to go to a place like this, which is also -- this place, this arena, which is built like a Greek amphitheatre, is a place for ecstasy also. We are participating in a reality that is different from that of the everyday life that we're used to. Now he says also that this is so intense an experience that it feels almost as if he didn't exist. You can't understand more than two people talking to you. And because all of these people I started interviewing -- this was an interview which is over 30 years old -- so many of the people described this as a spontaneous flow that I called this type of experience the ""flow experience."" This poet describes it as opening a door that floats in the sky -- a very similar description to what Albert Einstein gave as to how he imagined the forces of relativity, when he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked. It happens also, actually, in the most recent book I wrote, called ""Good Business,"" where I interviewed some of the CEOs who had been nominated by their peers as being both very successful and very ethical, very socially responsible. You see that these people define success as something that helps others and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are working at it. And two things that we measure is the amount of challenge people experience at that moment and the amount of skill that they feel they have at that moment. But you have a kind of a set point there, which would be in the middle. And you may be doing things very differently from other people, but for everyone that flow channel, that area there, will be when you are doing what you really like to do -- play the piano, be with your best friend, perhaps work, if work is what provides flow for you. So the question we are trying to address -- and I'm way over time -- is how to put more and more of everyday life in that flow channel.

314,"As for that first sphere of work, I think what Abraham Lincoln's life suggests is that fierce ambition is a good thing. But it wasn't simply for office or power or celebrity or fame -- what it was for was to accomplish something worthy enough in life so that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it. And with a beauty of language -- almost as if the Shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child had worked their way into his very soul. The Lyndon Johnson that I saw in the last years of his life, when I helped him on his memoirs, was a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit of work, power and individual success, that he had absolutely no psychic or emotional resources left to get him through the days once the presidency was gone. I like to believe it was because I was a good listener. But I also worried that part of it was that I was then a young woman. And because he was so sad and so vulnerable, he opened up to me in ways he never would have had I known him at the height of his power -- sharing his fears, his sorrows and his worries. It was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large that even the love of a family, without work, could not fill it. they said. So between his nightly treks to the theater, his story telling, and his extraordinary sense of humor and his love of quoting Shakespeare and poetry, he found that form of play which carried him through his days. It all began when I was only six years old, and my father taught me that mysterious art of keeping score while listening to baseball games -- so that when he went to work in New York during the day, I could record for him the history of that afternoon's Brooklyn Dodgers game. I must say, so fervent was my love of the old Brooklyn Dodgers in those days that I had to confess in my first confession two sins that related to baseball. So I had this sin on my soul when I went to my first confession. (Laughter) So he said, ""Look, I'll tell you something.

315,"And in a saying of the Koran, which to Muslims is God speaking to humanity, God says to his prophet Muhammad -- whom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets, beginning with Adam, including Noah, including Moses, including Abraham, including Jesus Christ, and ending with Muhammad -- that, ""We have not sent you, O Muhammad, except as a 'rahmah,' except as a source of compassion to humanity."" For us human beings, and certainly for us as Muslims, whose mission, and whose purpose in following the path of the prophet is to make ourselves as much like the prophet. That is all well and good, but where do we go wrong, and what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world? For the answer to this, we turn to our spiritual path. The famous Sufi master Rumi, who is very well known to most of you, has a story in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend, and he knocks on the door, and a voice answers, ""Who's there?"" In the presence of God, there is no room for more than one ""I,"" and that is the ""I"" of divinity. In a teaching -- called a ""hadith qudsi"" in our tradition -- God says that, ""My servant,"" or ""My creature, my human creature, does not approach me by anything that is dearer to me than what I have asked them to do."" You want your employees to do what you ask them to do, and if they've done that, then they can do extra. It is this merging of our self with divinity that is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions. That is a moment which is a gift of God to us -- a gift when, for a moment, he lifts that boundary which makes us insist on ""I, I, I, me, me, me,"" and instead, like the person in Rumi's story, we say, ""Oh, this is all you. This is all you. And us, and I, and us are all part of you. We have access to it all. But all this is for us to glorify the name of the creator whose primary name is the compassionating, the compassionate. God, Bokh, whatever name you want to call him with, Allah, Ram, Om, whatever the name might be through which you name or access the presence of divinity, it is the locus of absolute being, absolute love and mercy and compassion, and absolute knowledge and wisdom, what Hindus call ""satchidananda.""","In the Koran, God says to his prophet Muhammad, ""We have not sent you, O Muhammad, except as a source of compassion to humanity"" For us human beings, and certainly for us as Muslims, our purpose is to make ourselves as much like the prophet, he says. s the ""I"" of divinity.

317,"We spent a long time thinking about why this is, and it's just recently that we realized: it's when we see something unexpected, it changes our understanding of the way things work. You know, this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those metal sheets that they hang on the back of your door, in your closet, and you could literally stick your shoes up instead of using a shelf. So I just wanted to let you know, it's not actually coming out, just the concept is. One: the soft properties of the magnet that make it so that, if it were to hit the rider in the head, it wouldn't injure him. Now, I'm not going to get into the physics of it, but all you need to know is that the faster the magnet's falling, the greater the stopping force. ZK: Now, our next technology is actually a 10-foot pole, and I have it right here in my pocket. ZK: As we were talking to the vendor -- to try to learn about how you could apply these, or how they're being applied currently -- he was telling us that, in the military they use this one so soldiers can keep it on their chests -- very concealed -- and then, when they're out on the field, erect it as an antenna to clearly send signals back to the base. (Laughter) ZK: Now, for our next technology we're going to do a little demonstration, and so we need a volunteer from the audience. (Laughter) Come on up. Taking it a little further, if you wove those strips together -- kind of like a little basket -- you could make a shape-retaining sheet, and then you could embed it in a cloth: so you could make a picnic sheet that wraps around the table, so that way on a windy day it wouldn't blow away. Any place you use ink, you could change the way you interact with it.

318,"And itâ€™s the first time Iâ€™ve had a job where Iâ€™m afraid to go away because of everything thatâ€™s going to happen in this week when Iâ€™m here. (Laughter) But in any case, what Iâ€™m going to do in my little bit of time is take you on a quick tour of some of the things that we talk about and we think about. And this is, by the way, something that a democratic society also has to do. (Laughter) But one of the principles is that everybody who is part of the community gets to fight and argue as hard as they can for what they believe. But weâ€™re all disciplined by the understanding that the only people who are going to decide, you know, whether Iâ€™m right or somebody else is right, are the people in our community in the next generation, in 30 and 50 years. Not only is there a relationship between the ethics of science and the ethics of being a citizen in democracy, but there has been, historically, a relationship between how people think about space and time, and what the cosmos is, and how people think about the society that they live in. The first science of cosmology that was anything like science was Aristotelian science, and that was hierarchical. And everything in this universe has a place. Now, in the 17th century there was a revolution in thinking about space and time and motion and so forth of Newton. Now, similarly, in Lockeâ€™s society there are individuals who have certain rights, properties in a formal sense, and those are defined with respect to some absolute, abstract notions of rights and justice, and so forth, which are independent of what else has happened in the society. There is also an omniscient observer who knows everything, who is God, who is in a certain sense outside the universe, because he has no role in anything that happens, but is in a certain sense everywhere, because space is just the way that God knows where everything is, according to Newton, OK? And merging them together to make the final quantum theory of space and time and gravity, is the culmination of that, something thatâ€™s going on right now. All properties of things are about these kinds of relationships. Because thereâ€™s no place to put a maker outside, as there was in the Aristotelian and the Newtonian universe. And what weâ€™ve been working out is the implications, really, of the idea that the universe is made up of relations.","And itâ€™s the first time Iâ€™m afraid to go away.

319,"And when you listen to some of the presentations here -- and the extraordinary range of human capability, our understandings -- and then you contrast it with the fact we still call this planet, ""Earth:"" itâ€™s pretty extraordinary -- we have one foot in the dark ages.

OK, now. However, I came to realize gradually that they may be right -- and I have to convince all my colleagues that this is so, but Iâ€™m working on it. So let me explain to you why -- a very simple fact that tells you why this shape theory really does not work very well. This is cis-3-hexene-1-ol. Now, this is kind of interesting, because it tells you that you should be looking for a particular fact, which is this: nothing in the world smells like rotten eggs except S-H, OK? So here you have a system, you have something -- and thereâ€™s plenty of that stuff in biology -- some substance giving an electron, and the electron tries to jump, and only when a molecule comes along that has the right vibration does the reaction happen, OK? And one of the first things that happened was we started going around to fragrance companies asking for what they needed, because, of course, if you could calculate smell, you donâ€™t need chemists. So you can try a thousand molecules, you can try ten thousand molecules in a weekend, and then you only tell the chemists to make the right one. And one of the first things that happened was we went to see some perfumers in France -- and hereâ€™s where I do my Charles Fleischer impression -- and one of them says, ""You cannot make a coumarin."" And the first thing you do is you calculate the vibrational spectrum of coumarin, and you smooth it out, so that you have a nice picture of what the sort of chord, so to speak, of coumarin is. And I said, first of all, let me do the calculation on that compound, bottom right, which is related to coumarin, but has an extra pentagon inserted into the molecule. Youâ€™re right, and I donâ€™t care how you do it, in a sense; you bring me the molecules, you know.","This is cis-3-hexene-1-ol.

322,"Actually, I think the bad news about kin selection is just that it means that this kind of compassion is naturally deployed only within the family. The good news is compassion is natural. Again, I know this is not as inspiring a notion of compassion as you may have heard in the past, but from a biologist's point of view, this reciprocal altruism kind of compassion is ultimately self-serving too. It's not that people think that, when they feel the compassion. Now, if you've been paying attention, you're probably anticipating that there's bad news here; we still aren't to universal love, and it's true because, although an appreciation of the golden rule is natural, it's also natural to carve out exceptions to the golden rule. Now, we have a rationale for that. And the problem is that -- although in the case of sending people to prison, you have this impartial judiciary determining who gets excluded from the golden rule -- that in everyday life, the way we all make these decisions about who we're not going to extend the golden rule to, is we use a much rougher and readier formula. Now, if you're playing doubles, then the person on your side of the net is in a non-zero-sum relationship with you, because every point is either good for both of you -- positive, win-win -- or bad for both of you, it's lose-lose. So, kind of webs of non-zero-sumness are where you would expect compassion and the golden rule to kind of work their magic. So, I think that's good. For example, probably a lot of American Christians don't think of themselves as being in a non-zero-sum relationship with Muslims halfway around the world, but they really are, because if these Muslims become happier and happier with their place in the world and feel that they have a place in it, that's good for Americans, because there will be fewer terrorists to threaten American security. This is not the same as compassion, but it's conducive to compassion. And I'm afraid we have another good news/bad news story, which is that the moral imagination is part of human nature. It's their great calling right now, to get people all around the world better at expanding their moral imaginations, appreciating that in so many ways they're in the same boat. I would just sum up the way things look, at least from this secular perspective, as far as compassion and the golden rule go, by saying that it's good news that compassion and the golden rule are in some sense built into human nature.","The good news is compassion is natural.

323,"And it looked like a way to go, until you start thinking about, what does deep time do to a building? You need absolutely the right mountain if you're going to have a clock for 10,000 years. It would be a pilgrimage to get to it; it would be a serious hike to get up to where the clock is. So last June, the Long Now board, some staff and some donors and advisors, made a two-week expedition to the mountain to explore it and investigate, one, if it's the right mountain, and two, if it's the right mountain, how it might actually work for us. called ""January 7003,"" and it's ""Bell Studies for the Clock of the Long Now."" There it is. This is it. (Laughter) Now, I happened to be on the radio with Alexander when he got to this point at the base of the cliffs, and he said, quote,   ""There's a hidden notch. Now, Danny and I were up at this same area one day, and Danny looked over to the right and noticed something halfway up the cliffs, which is a kind of a porch or a cliff shelf with bristlecones on it, and supposed that people going up to the clock inside the mountain could come out onto that shelf and look down at the view. If you go up on top of those cliffs, that's some of the Long Now land in those trees. And if you go up there and look back, then you'll get a sense of what the view starts to be like from the top of the mountain. he's trying to determine if where he is on a bit of Long Now land would appear from down in the valley to be the actual peak of the mountain. And if you go out to that line of trees at the far end, you'll see what the valley used to look like. And a scheme emerged that Long Now is looking to see if it might be possible to buy up the whole valley, because those 10 ranches with their 17,000 acres dominate a 500 square mile valley with their grazing allotments and so on,   and there's a possibility that you could get the whole thing for five million dollars and gradually restore it to its wild condition, and somewhere in the process turn it back over to the National Park, and it would double the size of Great Basin National Park.

You look outside: you have all that beauty that you see, all that life that you see around you, and here we have intelligent people like you and I who are having a conversation here.

And so, on my 27th birthday I decided, because I argued so much and I talk so much, that I was going to stop speaking for just one day -- one day -- to give it a rest.

326,"So when we came back to Italy, and one of the things that I remember the most is my family having this hard time to share stories. And I remember really this desire to talk about Africa as a place where we lived and people live and go about their lives, and have dreams like we all have. Here I can tell a story of Africans making movies like I do, and actually I felt this was an inspiration for me. Aimee Corrigan, a very talented and young photographer, and Robert Caputo, a friend and a mentor, who is a veteran of National Geographic, and told me, ""You know, Franco, in 25 years of covering Africa, I don't know if I have come across a story that is so full of hope and so fun."" The plan was to give you a portrait of Nollywood, of this incredible film industry, following Bond in his quest to make an action movie that deals with the issue of corruption, called ""Checkpoint."" I mean, there are those films that people are making for quality, but the first thing you have to remember about this society is that Africa still has people that live on one dollar a day, and these are the people that really watch these films. Itâ€™s not just what you see in picture. Itâ€™s not just what you see in the picture. For a young man to really make it out here, you got to think of some negative things and all that, or some kind of vices. The Nigerian filmmakers really, really, are doing what they like. Iâ€™m very interested in it and I really think that the digital non-linear editing has slashed, you know, the cost now is a fraction of what it used to be. Filmmakers, friends of mine, they look at Nollywood and they say, ""Wow, they are doing what we really want to do, and make a buck and live with this job."" So this is what I really think. SO: I believe very soon, weâ€™re not only going to have better movies, we'll have that original Nigerian movie.

327,"It's two weeks into the genocide at that time, but of course, at that time you don't know how long it's going to last. And that's what that moment with Patricia Schroeder I think shows: that if we are to bring about an end to the world's worst atrocities, we have to make it such. It sees itself, such as it is, the it, as something that will create the impression that there will be political cost, there will be a political price to be paid, for allowing genocide, for not having an heroic imagination, for not being an upstander but for being, in fact, a bystander. They have a 1-800-GENOCIDE number -- this is going to sound very kitsch, but for those of you who may not be, I mean, may be apolitical, but interested in doing something about genocide, you dial 1-800-GENOCIDE and you type in your zip code, and you don't even have to know who your congressperson is. And the students and the others who are part of this incredibly energized base are there to answer that, and there's always something to do. Now, what this movement has done is it has extracted from the Bush administration from the United States, at a time of massive over-stretch -- military, financial, diplomatic -- a whole series of commitments to Darfur that no other country in the world is making. I think there are a couple -- there are many reasons -- but a couple just to focus on briefly. So this movement, if it's to be durable and global, will have to cross borders, and you will have to see other citizens in democracies, not simply resting on the assumption that their government would do something in the face of genocide, but actually making it such. He was in Lebanon. What do you do? Do you denounce? But all they had was a woman's handbag -- literally one of those basket handbags -- and they tied it to a curtain rope from one of the offices at U.N. headquarters, and created a pulley system into this shaft in this quivering building in the interests of rescuing this person, the person we most need to turn to now, this shepherd, at a time when so many of us feel like we're lacking guidance. Don't you see it's unacceptable what you're doing? If we think about dignity in our conduct as citizens and as individuals with relation to the people around us, and as a country, if we could inject a regard for dignity into our dealings with other countries, it would be something of a revolution. And the lesson, I think, of the anti-genocide movement that I mentioned, that is a partial success but by no means has it achieved what it has set out to do -- it'll be many decades, probably, before that happens -- but is that if we want to see change, we have to become the change.","""If we are to bring about an end to the world's worst atrocities, we have to make it such"" ""There will be political cost, there will be a political price to be paid"" ""You don't even have to know who your congressperson is"" The U.S. is making commitments to Darfur that no other country is making, he says.

328,"The people on the tracks just continued to watch them. The water had started coming back. In about two minutes, it had reached the level of the railroad tracks and was coming over it. We don't think another wave is coming right away. In the world of blogs, there's going to be before the tsunami and after the tsunami, because one of the things that happened in the wake of the tsunami was that, although initially -- that is, in that first day -- there was actually a kind of dearth of live reporting, there was a dearth of live video and some people complained about this. What became very clear was that, within a few days, the outpouring of information was immense, and we got a complete and powerful picture of what had happened in a way that we never had been able to get before. And what you had was a group of essentially unorganized, unconnected writers, video bloggers, etc., who were able to come up with a collective portrait of a disaster that gave us a much better sense of what it was like to actually be there than the mainstream media could give us. One of the fascinating things about the blogosphere specifically, and, of course, the Internet more generally -- and it's going to seem like a very obvious point, but I think it is an important one to think about -- is that the people who are generating these enormous reams of content every day, who are spending enormous amounts of time organizing, linking, commenting on the substance of the Internet, are doing so primarily for free. You know, if you think about something like Google, which essentially is relying on the collective intelligence of the Web to seek out those sites that have the most valuable information -- we know that Google does an exceptionally good job of doing that, and it does that because, collectively, this disorganized thing we call the ""World Wide Web"" actually has a remarkable order, or a remarkable intelligence in it. But what the blogosphere offers is the possibility of getting at the kind of collective, distributive intelligence that is out there, and that we know is available to us if we can just figure out a way of accessing it. But there is a dark side to this, and that's what I want to spend the last part of my talk on. It is very easy to think that networks are necessarily good things -- that being linked from one place to another, that being tightly linked in a group, is a very good thing. But there's also a downside to this -- a kind of dark side, in fact -- and that is that the more tightly linked we've become to each other, the harder it is for each of us to remain independent. So, one of the phenomena that's very clear in the blogosphere is that once a meme, once an idea gets going, it is very easy for people to just sort of pile on, because other people have, say, a link. Now, I want to connect this back, though, to the tsunami, because one of the great things about the tsunami -- in terms of the blogosphere's coverage, not in terms of the tsunami itself -- is that it really did represent a genuine bottom-up phenomenon.","The people on the tracks just continued to watch them.

329,"Donâ€™t know what they do with that, but they have one. So the way they work is, you know, you just put your finger in the thing, pull them back, and off you go. I think Iâ€™m going to take these off now, because I canâ€™t see a damn thing when Iâ€™ve -- all right, OK. Thatâ€™s what it is, isnâ€™t it? So for example, you could turn one into a football, or another one into a sun. I want you to do as many of them as you can, in the minute that Iâ€™m just about to give you. So that ability just to go for it and explore lots of things, even if they donâ€™t seem that different from each other, is actually something that kids do well, and it is a form of play. For those of you around in the '60s, you probably know it well. As a result, weâ€™d all feel perfectly secure and have a good time -- but because we all understood the rules and we agreed on them together. As designers, we need to be able to transition in and out of play also. I think this is particularly true if we think about the sort of -- I think whatâ€™s very different about design is that we go through these two very distinctive modes of operation. Itâ€™s not an either/or; itâ€™s an ""and."" You can be serious and play. And there are a series of behaviors that weâ€™ve learnt as kids, and that turn out to be quite useful to us as designers. They include exploration, which is about going for quantity; building, and thinking with your hands; and role-play, where acting it out helps us both to have more empathy for the situations in which weâ€™re designing, and to create services and experiences that are seamless and authentic.","Donâ€™t know what they do with that, but they have one.

We may not be able to stop it, but the likelihood that it will get past us is lower if we focus on that problem. But above all, what we have to do is we have to help the good guys, the people on the defensive side, have an advantage over the people who want to abuse things.

334,"The fact is, when we do our market research around the world, we see there's a nearly universal aspiration on the part of people to own an automobile -- 750 million people in the world today own a car. We really have to ask the question: Can the world sustain that number of automobiles? And if you look at projections over the next 10 to 15 to 20 years, it looks like the world car park could grow to on the order of 1.1 billion vehicles. If we were to reinvent the automobile today, rather than 100 years ago, knowing what we know about the issues associated with our product and about the technologies that exist today, what would we do? A lot of hydrogen is produced today in the world. What we've targeted for ourselves -- and we're making great progress toward this goal -- is to have a propulsion system based on hydrogen and fuel cells, designed and validated, that can go head-to-head with the internal combustion engine. So since we can't predict the future, we want to spend a lot of our time trying to create that future. Now, if you take the power-generating capability of an automobile and you compare that to the electric grid in the United States, it turns out that the power in four percent of the automobiles equals that of the electric grid of the US. And hydrogen and fuel cells give us that opportunity to actually use our cars and trucks when they're parked to generate electricity for the grid. Talk about the ultimate swarm -- having all of the processors and all of the cars when they're sitting idle being part of a global grid for computing capability. And the key to all of this is to make it affordable, to make it exciting, to get it on a pathway where there's a way to make money doing it. I just want to ask one. Are you serious about it, and not just, you know, when the consumers want it, when the regulators force us to do it, we will go there? We're into this over a billion dollars already, so I would hope people would think we're serious when we're spending that kind of money. And we want to be the first one to create it, Chris.","750 million people in the world today own a car.

336,"And although we know that the land animals I'm going to talk about are just the scum of the Earth on the land -- the little bits of land floating around -- but they are important to us because they're sort of in our scale of experience from millimeters to meters. And so my work, really, is trying to understand the character of that Mesozoic radiation compared to the Cenozoic radiation to see what mysteries we can understand from dinosaurs and from other animals about what life on drifting continents really can tell us about evolution. Why didn't they do all these things, and if they didn't do all these things, what kinds of animals were in those spaces? Yes, they do have larger body size, but many of them are smaller, but we're interested in the time it took them to achieve that. We now know this transition is the one time that dinosaurs actually went below that body size -- we're going to see where they began in a minute -- and it is the one time that they rapidly invaded all the habitats I just told you that dinosaurs weren't in. I thought if I'm going to understand dinosaur evolution, I'd have to go back to those beds where they had picked up fragments, go back to a time and a place where the earliest dinosaurs existed. When you pick up something like this -- and some of you have had the chance to touch it -- this is a piece of history. You're going to have to get on the back legs. And the fourth thing is that you actually did one or the other of those three things, but the paleontologist never found you. Today I'm going to spend the rest of my few minutes up here talking about the other stuff that I do in Chicago, which is related to the fact that I never -- and actually, in talking to a lot of TEDsters, there's a number of you out there -- I don't know that I'd get an answer honestly, if I asked you to raise your hand, but there are a number of you out there that started your scientific, technical, entertainment career as failures, by society's standards, as failures by schools. I was one of those. It takes us years to understand how to do that with dinosaurs. What about all the kids like me that were in school -- kids like some of you out there -- that were in school and didn't get a chance and will never get a chance to participate in science and technology?

337,"You can see the range of the Coast Redwoods. And, Chris, if I could have you up here? OK. And maybe about here, about 30 feet, is the diameter of a big Redwood. That is to say, at that time it was believed that there was nothing up there except the branches of Redwood trees. He climbed up a small tree next to this giant Redwood, and then he leaped through space and grabbed a branch with his hands, and ended up hanging, like catching a bar of a trapeze. But they made it to the top, and what they found was not a Redwood desert, but a lost world -- a kind of three-dimensional labyrinth in the air, filled with unknown life. There they are. When you get near the top of the tree, you feel like you can't fall -- in fact, it's difficult to move. And then it bursts into a forest of Redwoods. There are some interesting theories that, if I had time, I would tell you about. But as you go and you look closer at a tree, what you see is, you see increasing complexity. One of the things that is just -- I almost can't conceive it -- is the idea that the national news media hasn't picked this up at all, and this is the devastation of one of the most important ecosystems in North America. But we're different from trees, and they can also teach us something about ourselves in the differences that we have. (Applause) Chris Anderson: I think at a previous TED, I think it was Nathan Myhrvold who told me that it was thought that because these trees are like, 2,000 years and older, on many of them there are ecosystems where there are species that are not found anywhere on the Earth except on that one tree.

338,"(Laughter) Now, chances are that over the last winter, if you had been a beehive, either you or one of the two people you just nodded at would have died. We know that there are these varroa mites that have introduced and caused a lot of losses, and we also have this new phenomenon, which I talked about last year, Colony Collapse Disorder. And what we know is that it's as if the bees have caught a flu. Now of course, if you lose a lot of colonies, beekeepers can replace them very quickly. And it's really important to talk about beekeepers first, because beekeepers are among the most fascinating people you'll ever meet. (Laughter) And you get all of these people in the same room, and they're all engaged and they're getting along, and they're all there because of the passion for bees. And you can do that one year in a row, you may be able to do it two years in a row. Now, I want to just illustrate that in the fact that if we look at the breakfast I had yesterday morning -- a little cranberry juice, some fruits, some granola, I should have had whole wheat bread, I realized, but you know, jam on my Wonderbread, and some coffee -- and had we taken out all those ingredients, -- except for the almonds I wasn't going to pick out from the granola -- if we had taken out all those ingredients the bees had indirectly or directly pollinated, we wouldn't have much on our plate. And so, in fact, if you know you have these kleptoparasitic bees, you know that your environment is healthy, because they're top-of-the-food-chain bees. And in fact, if you guys live on the West Coast, go to these websites here, and they're really looking for people to look for some of these bumblebees, because we think some have gone extinct. And so it's not just honeybees that are in trouble, but we don't understand these native pollinators or all those other parts of our community. I think that there is perhaps some advantage to keeping lawns at a limited scale, and I think we're encouraged to do that. Add to watch the different plants, or insects, that come to these flowers, to watch that -- and we've heard about, you know, this relationship you can have with wine, this companion you can have as it matures and as it has these different fragrances.

339,"And so for me, I know that when the Internet came around and I was doing computer programming and just, you know, just generally trying to run my own little company and figure out what to do with the Internet and with computers, I was just immediately struck by how the ultimate thing that you would really want to do with the Internet and with computers would be to use the Internet and connected computers to simulate a world to sort of recreate the laws of physics and the rules of how things went together -- the sort of -- the idea of atoms and how to make things, and do that inside a computer so that we could all get in there and make stuff. And then the second thing is that there's this tangible sense that if you travel far enough, you can find out there -- oh, yeah -- you have no idea what you're going to find once you get there, into space. And in fact, it's going to be so different than what we see here on earth that anything is going to be possible. You know, to give you a size idea about scale, you know, comparing space to Second Life, most people don't realize, kind of -- and then this is just like the Internet in the early '90s. I'd say I kind of think about the world as being information. That's one way of organizing information, but there are two things about the way you access information in a virtual world that I think are the important ways that they're very different and much better than what we've been able to do to date with the Web. When you're on Amazon.com and you're looking for digital cameras or whatever, you're on there right now, when you're on the site, with like 5,000 other people, but you can't talk to them. And so I think, again, that it's likely that in the next decade or so these virtual worlds are going to be the most common way as human beings that we kind of use the electronics of the Internet, if you will, to be together, to consume information. You have to have that level of freedom, and so I'm often asked that, you know, is there a, kind of, utopian or, is there a utopian tendency to Second Life and things like it, that you would create a world that has a grand scheme to it? But more generally, you know, one other example I think about this, which is great relative to the utopian idea. And what was so amazing right from the start was that the idea that we had put out in the zoning concept, basically, was instantly and thoroughly ignored, and like, two months into the whole thing, -- which is really a small amount of time, even in Second Life time -- I remember the users, the people who were then using Second Life, the residents came to me and said, we want to buy the disco -- because I had built it -- we want to buy that land and raze it and put houses on it. So as you go from age 30 to age 60 -- and there are many people in their sixties using Second Life -- this is also not a sharp curve -- it's very, very distributed -- usage goes up in terms of, like, hours per week by 40 percent as you go from age 30 to age 60 in real life, so there's not -- many people make the mistake of believing that Second Life is some kind of an online game. In terms of psychographic, you know, the people in Second Life are remarkably dissimilar relative to what you might think, when you go in and talk to them and meet them, and I would, you know, challenge you to just do this and find out. So, that's it. That is to say, it's a big change, but it isn't avoidable.","When the Internet came around and I was doing computer programming, I was just immediately struck by how the ultimate thing that you would really want to do with the Internet and with computers would be to simulate a world.

Here's an example: if I were to tell you, let's play a little coin toss game, and I'm going to flip a coin, and if it comes up heads, I'm going to pay you 10 dollars, but you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing with me, most of you would say, sure, I'll take that bet. Because you know that the odds of you winning are one half, the gain if you do is 10 dollars, that multiplies to five, and that's more than I'm charging you to play. The reason is, this isn't how people do odds. The expected value of this lottery is two dollars; this is a lottery in which you should invest your money. Most of you have the intuition that it's not -- you wouldn't pay that for it. And I'm going to show you one or two of them. One of the things we know about comparison: that when we compare one thing to the other, it changes its value. Now, you can see, this is the problem of shifting comparisons, because what you're doing is, you're comparing the 100 bucks to the purchase that you're making, but when you go to spend that money you won't be making that comparison. Here's the first easy problem: You can have 60 dollars now or 50 dollars now. What do we know? What is it? That's what you think it is. That isn't one of them, for me, but there's many others.

344,"And so one of the questions that I asked you is, when you look around, what do you see? If you look at this picture, what you will see is a lot of dark with some light objects in it. But there's a lot of other galaxies, and some are nearby, and they're kind of the color of the Sun, and some are further away and they're a little bluer, and so forth. But when you look at some of these regions like this, you'll see more galaxies than stars, which is kind of a conundrum. So if you take a picture of what's going on, it's 10 years ago. And you'll see, first, the structure of the survey, and then you'll start seeing the structure of the galaxies that we see out there. How are you going to put galaxies out there in a pattern like that? So I'm going to show you the results of a very large-scale simulation of what we think the universe might be like, using, essentially, some of the play principles and some of the design principles that, you know, humans have labored so hard to pick up, but apparently nature knew how to do at the beginning. We're going to zoom in, but this is a plot of what it is. It's transparent to light, but in order for you to see it, we're going to make it white. Now we're going to zoom back out, and you can see this structure that, when we get very far out, looks very regular, but it's made up of a lot of irregular variations. It's only when you look at it at a very large scale, and explore it and so forth, you realize it's a very intricate, complicated kind of a design, right? And so here we are. So there it is. So we're just seeing as large a scale structure as we can see, and then only things that have started forming already are going to form, and then from then on it's going to go on.","CNN's John Sutter shows a large-scale simulation of what we think the universe might be like. Sutter: ""Apparently nature knew how to"" This is a plot of what it is. It's transparent to light, but in order for you to see it, we're going to make it white. We're just seeing as large a scale structure as we can see, and then only things that have started forming already are going to form.","At Serious Play 2008, astrophysicist George Smoot shows stunning new images from deep-space surveys, and prods us to ponder how the cosmos -- with its giant webs of dark matter and mysterious gaping voids -- got built this way."
345,"And so, if you'll put up with this, I would like to enlist your help with a first experiment today. I would like to see if this audience would -- no, you haven't practiced, as far as I know -- can you get it together to clap in sync? Now, to get into that, let me begin with what might have occurred to you immediately when you hear that we're talking about synchrony in nature, which is the glorious example of birds that flock together, or fish swimming in organized schools. Okay, well, the issue then is, do we need to be alive to see this kind of spontaneous order, and I've already hinted that the answer is no. You don't have to be alive. So here it is. Let's see if we can get this to work. So there we go. So they built the blade of light, and it's a very thin ribbon of steel, the world's -- probably the flattest and thinnest suspension bridge there is, with cables that are out on the side. Woman: Yeah, it felt unstable, and it was very windy, and I remember it had lots of flags up and down the sides, so you could definitely -- there was something going on sideways, it felt, maybe. Interviewer: So just show me how you walk normally. And then show me what it was like when the bridge started to go. And it seemed obvious to me that it was probably the number of people on it. Now, you might not be used to thinking of yourself as a metronome, but after all, we do walk like -- I mean, we oscillate back and forth as we walk. But also, after you see the bridge on opening day, you'll see an interesting clip of work done by a bridge engineer at Cambridge named Allan McRobie, who figured out what happened on the bridge, and who built a bridge simulator to explain exactly what the problem was.","CNN.com's John Sutter asks the audience to clap in sync. He says the answer is no, you don't have to be alive to see this kind of spontaneous order. The audience claps. ""There was definitely -- there was something going on sideways, it felt, maybe. And it seemed obvious to me that it was probably the number of people on it,"" says Allan McRobie.","Mathematician Steven Strogatz shows how flocks of creatures (like birds, fireflies and fish) manage to synchronize and act as a unit -- when no one's giving orders.

346,"Unless we do something to prevent it, over the next 40 years weâ€™re facing an epidemic of neurologic diseases on a global scale. A cheery thought. On this map, every country thatâ€™s colored blue has more than 20 percent of its population over the age of 65. This is the world we live in. And this is why thatâ€™s not entirely a good thing: because over the age of 65, your risk of getting Alzheimerâ€™s or Parkinsonâ€™s disease will increase exponentially. By 2050, thereâ€™ll be about 32 million people in the United States over the age of 80, and unless we do something about it, half of them will have Alzheimerâ€™s disease and three million more will have Parkinsonâ€™s disease. Interestingly enough, other neurologic diseases which affect very different parts of the brain also show tangles of misfolded protein, which suggests that the approach might be a general one, and might be used to cure many neurologic diseases, not just Alzheimerâ€™s disease. And this is a connection that most people arenâ€™t pursuing right now, but which weâ€™re fascinated by. Most of the important and all of the creative work in this area is being funded by private philanthropies. In the meantime, while weâ€™re waiting for all these things to happen, hereâ€™s what you can do for yourself. As far as protecting yourself against Alzheimerâ€™s disease, well, it turns out that fish oil has the effect of reducing your risk for Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Itâ€™s also the biggest risk factor for glaucoma, which is just Alzheimerâ€™s disease of the eye. And of course, when it comes to cognitive effects, ""use it or lose it"" applies, so you want to stay mentally stimulated. But hey, youâ€™re listening to me. Thank you.","Unless we do something to prevent it, over the next 40 years weâ€™re facing an epidemic of neurologic diseases on a global scale.

347,"It's amazing, when you meet a head of state and you say, ""What is your most precious natural resource?"" -- they will not say children at first. (Video): We're traveling today with the Minister of Defense of Colombia, head of the army and the head of the police, and we're dropping off 650 laptops today to children who have no television, no telephone and have been in a community cut off from the rest of the world for the past 40 years. There are one billion children in the world, and 50 percent of them don't have electricity at home or at school. And in some countries -- let me pick Afghanistan -- 75 percent of the little girls don't go to school. So, in rough numbers, there are a million laptops. It's the Minister of Defense with whom we're working, not the Minister of Education, because it is seen as a strategic defense issue in the sense of liberating these zones that had been completely closed off, in which the people who had been causing, if you will, 40 years' worth of bombings and kidnappings and assassinations lived. And that engine is going to see the results in 20 years. Now what are some of the results? They own the laptops. And so when I met with three children from the schools, who had traveled all day to come to Bogota, one of the three children brought her mother. And then, just think -- they can have, let's say, 100 books. You and I didn't have 10,000 books when we went to primary school. And by being a zero-dollar laptop, we can go to countries that can't afford it at all. And think of the laptop as a vaccine.","There are one billion children in the world, and 50 percent of them don't have electricity at home or at school.

Youâ€™re going to find out why in a minute, because when I went to see Eileen, this is what I said I wanted to build. This is the Library of Human Imagination.

(Laughter) So you can see here in the lower level of the library the books and the objects. Part of the question that I have answered is, is we create by surrounding ourselves with stimuli: with human achievement, with history, with the things that drive us and make us human -- the passionate discovery, the bones of dinosaurs long gone, the maps of space that weâ€™ve experienced, and ultimately the hallways that stimulate our mind and our imagination. So hopefully tomorrow Iâ€™ll show one or two more objects from the stage, but for today I just wanted to say thank you for all the people that came and talked to us about it.

350,"And that is a wonderful stepping away in perspective, to try to then think about the way our planet behaves, as a planet, and with the life that's on it. How hard is it going to be to find life on Mars? So, what about life on Mars? And so where there is water, there is a very high chance of our kind of life. There's clearly sedimentary rocks all over the place â€“ one of the landers is sitting in the middle of an ancient seabed, and there are these amazing structures called blueberries, which are these little, rocky concretions that we are busy making biologically in my lab right now. I think it's there, and I think we need to go look for it, and I think it's underground. How do you know it when you find it? But the real issue is that we are guided by our limited experience, and until we can think out of the box of our cranium and what we know, then we can't recognize what to look for, or how to plan for it.

We know that on Mars and the Moon there are tons of these structures. And the future is there for us to use these lava-tube caves on Mars. The question as to whether there is life on Mars that is related to life on Earth has now been very muddied, because we now know, from Mars meteorites that have made it to Earth, that there's material that can be exchanged between those two planets. One of the burning questions, of course, is if we go there and find life in the sub-surface, as I fully expect that we will, is that a second genesis of life?","Where there is water, there is a very high chance of our kind of life.

Is this Chinese food?"" So, you know, I realized when I was there, General Tso is kind of a lot like Colonel Sanders in America, in that he's known for chicken and not war. So, these people are going around China asking for chop suey, which is sort of like a Japanese guy coming here and saying, ""I understand you have a very popular dish in your country called 'leftovers.'"" And if you see under the word ""Clears"" -- very small -- it says, ""They must go,"" which refers not only to the rats, but to the Chinese in their midst, because the way that the food was perceived was that these people who ate foods different from us must be different from us.

352,"(Laughter) Which was -- back then it was sort of, you know, well, you know -- if you made this thing -- he made this little device, like kind of like a bicycle pump in reverse that could suck all the air out of -- you know what a bell jar is? And people in the 17th century, they didn't really understand the same way we do about you know, this stuff is a bunch of different kinds of molecules, and we breathe it in for a purpose and all that. I mean, these are -- it's kind of weird to think that someone had to do an experiment to show that, but that was what was going on at the time. And, I mean -- this kind of stuff, you know, all this stuff came from that separation of this little sort of thing that we do -- now I, when I was a boy was born sort of with this idea that if you want to know something -- you know, maybe it's because my old man was gone a lot, and my mother didn't really know much science, but I thought if you want to know something about stuff, you do it -- you make an experiment, you know. (Laughter) You sort of -- now you say, well, let's see if I can get hold of some potassium chlorate and sugar, perchlorate and sugar, and heat it; it would be interesting to see what it is they don't want me to do, and what it is going to -- and how is it going to work.

I mean, you can talk about that stuff, and you can write these large reports, and you can get government money to do it, but these -- they actually measured it, and it turns out that in the last 10 years -- that's why they say ""decadal"" there -- that the energy -- that the level of what they call ""imbalance"" has been way the hell over what was expected.

353,"In 1962, Buckminster Fuller presented the particularly audacious proposal for the Geoscope. LEDs are smaller, they're cheaper, they're longer lasting, they're more efficient. Most importantly for this, they're faster. And this speed, combined with today's high-performance micro-controllers, allows us to actually simulate, in this piece, over 17,000 LEDs -- using just 64. And so you could see that as this disc rotates about this axis, it will create a disc of light that we can control. But what is new is that, when we rotate this disc about this axis, this disc of light actually becomes a sphere of light. And so we can control that with micro-controllers and create a fully volumetric, three-dimensional display with just 256 LEDs. Now this piece is currently in process -- due out in May -- but what we've done is we've put together a small demo, just to show the geometric translation of points into a sphere. I've got a little video to show you, but keep in mind that this is with no electronic control, and this is also with only four LEDs. This is actually only about 1.5 percent of what the final display will be in May. And here you can see it's rotating about the vertical axis only, creating circles.

355,"I thought this was a little strange at the time. Dad wasn't a real militaristic kind of guy; he just felt bad that he wasn't able to fight in World War II on account of his handicap, although they did let him get through the several-hour-long army physical exam before they got to the very last test, which was for vision. He had faith in my abilities as a cartoonist, even though he had no direct evidence that I was any good whatsoever; everything he saw was just a blur. Same thing: he understood the shape of the future, even though it was something that would only be implemented by people much later. Now, we've seen a lot of examples of people who are pursuing that sort of vision in science, but I think it's also true in the arts, it's true in politics, it's even true in personal endeavors. I think these are the four principles that go into this. One of the most important things about comics that I discovered was that comics are a visual medium, but they try to embrace all of the senses within it. Also, another sense which comics' vision represents, and that's time. So I wrote a book about this in '93, but as I was finishing the book, I had to do a little bit of typesetting, and I was tired of going to my local copy shop to do it, so I bought a computer. And it was just a little thing -- it wasn't good for much except text entry -- but my father had told me about Moore's law back in the '70s, and I knew what was coming. The problem was that if you go with this basic idea that space equals time in comics, what happens is that when you introduce sound and motion, which are temporal phenomena that can only be represented through time, they break with that continuity of presentation. Each of them has a single unbroken reading line, whether it's going zigzag across the walls or spiraling up a column or just straight left to right, or even going in a backwards zigzag across those 88 accordion-folded pages, the same thing is happening; that is, that the basic idea that as you move through space you move through time, is being carried out without any compromise, but there were compromises when print hit. This was back in the late '90s, and other people in my business thought I was pretty crazy, but a lot of people then went on and actually did it. But even though we're only experiencing it one piece at a time, that's just where the technology is right now. See what's going on here as we draw these stories on an infinite canvas is you're creating a more pure expression of what this medium is all about.","I thought this was a little strange at the time.

356,"And I used three criteria: the first was, I thought I'd talk about real design within reach, design that's free, not design not quite within reach, as we're fondly known by our competition and competitors, but stuff that you can find on the streets, stuff that was free, stuff that was available to all people, and stuff that probably contains some other important messages. And I had a bit of a wake-up call in Amsterdam: I was there going into the design stores, and mixing with our crowd of designers, and I recognized that a whole lot of stuff pretty much looked the same, and the effect of globalization has had that in our community also. I was walking around on the streets of Amsterdam and I recognized, you know, the big story from Amsterdam isn't what's in the design stores, it's what's out on the streets, and maybe it's self-explanatory, but a city that hasn't been taken over by modernism, that's preserved its kind of architecture and character, and where the bicycle plays an important part of the way in which people get around and where pedestrian rights are protected. I then kind of thought about the other cities in Europe where I spend a lot of time looking for design, like Basel, where Vitra is located, or in northern Italy -- all cities where there are a whole lot of bicycles, and where pedestrian areas -- and I came to the conclusion that perhaps there was something about these important design centers that dealt with bicycles and foot traffic, and I'm sure the skeptic eye would say, no, the correlation there is that there are universities and schools where people can't afford cars, but it did seem that in many of these areas pedestrian traffic was protected. But there were lots of other things going on in this area: it was a kind of construction zone; a lot of buildings were going up. And, approaching a building from a distance, you don't see too much; you get a little closer, and you arrive at a nice little composition that might remind you of a Mondrian or a Diebenkorn or something. But to me it was an example of industrial materials with a little bit of colors and animation and a nice little still life -- kind of unintended piece of design. They give me, I don't know, a sense of correctness in the world and some visual delight in the knowledge that the building will probably never look as good as this simple industrial scaffolding that is there to serve. And I realized that, you know, Italy is a place where they can accept these different ideologies and deal with diversity and not have the problem, or they can choose to ignore them, but these -- you don't have warring factions, and I think that maybe the tolerance of the absurdity which has made Italy so innovative   and so tolerant. The past and the present work quite well together in Italy also, and I think that it's recognizable there, and has an important effect on culture, because their public spaces are protected, their sidewalks are protected, and you're actually able to confront these things physically, and I think this helps people get over their fear of modernism and other such things. And as I look at it, I sort of say, you know, the publications that report on problems in the urban area also contribute to it, and it's just my call to say to all of us, public policy won't change this at all; private industry has to work to take things like this seriously. Now, this is not going to impress you guys who Photoshop, and can do stuff,  but this was an actual moment when I got off my bike, and I looked and I thought, it's as if all of my biker brethren had kind of gotten together and conspired to make a little statement. And I do think pattern has the capability of eradicating some of the most evil forces of society, such as bad form in restaurants, but quite seriously, it was a statement to me that one thing that you do, sort of, see is the aggressive nature of the industrial world has produced -- kind of, large masses of things, and when you -- in monoculture, and I think the preservation of diversity in culture is something that's important to us. The U.S. is actually becoming a bit of a leader in kind of enlightened urban planning and renewal, and I want to single out a place like Chicago, where I look at some guy like Mayor Daley as a bit of a design hero for being able to work through the political processes and all that to improve an area. And it's a welcoming area, I think, inclusive of diversity, reflective of diversity, and I think this marriage of both technology and art in the public sector is an area where the U.S. can really take a leadership role, and Chicago is one example.","""I had a bit of a wake-up call in Amsterdam: I was there going into the design stores, and mixing with our crowd of designers, and I recognized that a whole lot of stuff pretty much looked the same,"" he says.

357,"So much has that happened that I've developed a fairly praticed response, which is: I point out that first of all, you have to understand that there is no such thing as an inauthentic experience. (Laughter) And the Dutch, they always go ... and they realize, I'm right! And now, with the experience economy, it's about rendering authenticity. Well, if you think about that, you do, in fact, get a two-by-two. And of course, if you are both true to yourself, and are what you say you are, then you're real real! All right, now, there is value for fake. Fact is, there's a general rule: if you don't like it, it's fake; if you do like it, it's faux. (Laughter) Now, the other two sides of the coin are: being a real fake -- is what it says it is, but is not true to itself, or being a fake real: is true to itself, but not what it says it is. It is what it says it is: It's Universal Studio; it's in the city of Los Angeles; you're going to walk a lot. It's not what it says it is. Right, the key of being true to yourself is knowing who you are as a business. When it comes to being what you say you are, the easiest mistake that companies make is that they advertise things that they are not. So, the number one thing to do when it comes to being what you say you are, is to provide places for people to experience who you are. That's why you have companies like Starbucks, right, that doesn't advertise at all. But surround the brewing of that coffee with the ambiance of a Starbucks, with the authentic cedar that goes inside of there, and now, because of that authentic experience, you can charge two, three, four, five dollars for a cup of coffee.","So much has happened that I've developed a fairly praticed response, which is: I point out that there is no such thing as an inauthentic experience.

358,"We've seen the creation of small computers in the '70s and early '80s, and who would have thought back then that every single person would not have just one computer but probably 20, in your home, and in not just your P.C. A genome is really a description for  all of the DNA that is in a living organism. We've also along the way discovered that this is a very old molecule, that all of the DNA in your body has been around forever, since the beginning of us, of us as creatures. Look at this screen here and, you know, you see pictures and you see words, but really all there are are ones and zeros. In fact, many, many diseases we have struggled with for a long time, like cancer, we haven't been able to cure because we just don't understand how it works at the genomic level. So, up to this point we tried to fix it by using what I call shit-against-the-wall pharmacology, which means, well, let's just throw chemicals at it, and maybe it's going to make it work. And if you think about the computer industry and how we've gone from big computers to little ones and how they get more powerful and faster all the time, the same thing is happening with gene sequencing now: we are on the cusp of being able to sequence human genomes for about 5,000 dollars in about an hour or a half-hour; you will see that happen in the next five years. It will be here. You will give your genome to the pharmacist, and your drug will be made for you and it will work much better than the ones that were -- you won't have side effects. If you saw the genome for a mouse or for a human it would look no different than this, but what scientists are doing now is they're understanding what these do and what they mean. So, what can we do with genomes now that we can read them, now that we're starting to have the book of life? Now, you have the genome and you say to yourself, So, if I plug this synthetic genome -- if I pull the old one out and plug it in -- does it just boot up and live? So, what do you do? Well, you know, we really, we argue and debate about it -- we say it's climate, it's soil, it's this. I just ask the question, if you could cure all disease -- if you could make disease go away, because we understand how it actually works, if we could end hunger by being able to create nutritious, healthy plants that grow in very hard-to-grow environments, if we could create clean and plentiful energy -- we, right in the labs at Synthetic Genomics, have single-celled organisms that are taking carbon dioxide and producing a molecule very similar to gasoline.","A genome is really a description for all of the DNA that is in a living organism.

359,"Natalie MacMaster: I'm going to just quickly start out with a little bit of music here. Well, I'm really excited to talk a bit about my own upbringing in music and family and all of that, but I'm even more excited for you people to hear about Donnell's amazing family and maybe even a little bit about how we met, and all that sort of thing, but for those of you that may not be familiar with my upbringing, I'm from Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, eastern Canada, which is a very, very musical island, and its origins come from Scotland with the music and all the traditions, the dancing, the language, which unfortunately is dying out in Cape Breton. Well, cÃ¨ilidh first of all is Gaelic for party, but kitchen party in Cape Breton is very common, and basically somebody drops into the house, and no matter what house you go to in Cape Breton, there's a fiddle there, guaranteed, and I'd say, well there's first of all more fiddlers per capita in Cape Breton than anywhere in the world, so ten chances to one, the fellow who walked in the door could play it, so you'd have someone come into the house, you'd invite them to play a tune, and lo and behold a little party would start up and somebody would dance, and somebody would sing, and all that sort of thing, so it was a wonderful, wonderful way to grow up, and that is where my beginnings in music come from: my surroundings, my family, just my bloodline in itself, and, oh, I've done lots of things with my music. I was nominated for a Grammy and I've won some awards and stuff like that, so that's awesome, but the best part was meeting my husband, and I've actually known Donnell for probably 12 years now, and I'm going to get into a little bit of, I guess, how music brought us together, but I'm going to introduce you right now to my new husband as of October 5, Donnell Leahy. Years ago, hundreds of men would go up for the winter to the camps in Northern Ontario and in Quebec, and they were all different cultures, and the Irish, the French, Scottish, German, they'd all meet, and of course at night, they'd play cards and step dance and play fiddles, and over the course of many years, the Ottawa Valley fiddling kind of evolved and the Ottawa Valley step dancing evolved, so that's, I kind of started out with that style and I quickly started doing my own thing, and then I met Natalie, and I was exposed to the great Cape Breton fiddling. Well, it's just so interesting that Donnell's upbringing was very similar to mine, and I actually saw Donnell play when I was about 12 years old, and he and his family came to Inverness, which is about 45 minutes from where I lived, and I was just blown away, like, it was just amazing, and you'll find out why pretty soon here, but I couldn't believe the fiddling and Mom was there with me, and she was saying â€” Donnell's mother came up on stage and danced with her children, and Mom was saying, ""That's Julie MacDonnell, I used to dance with her when we were kids. (Laughter) (Applause) DL: So anyway, we're running out of time, so I'll just get to it. I'm going to play a piece of music for you. I'll quickly play a short part of the air, and then I'm going to get into kind of a crazy tune that is very difficult to play when you're not warmed up, so, if I mess it up, pretend you like it anyway. And so, you know, Donnell and I are actually in the process of writing new pieces of music together that we can play, but we don't have any of those ready. (Applause) (Tuning) DL: What do you want to play? Before Mom's family had a piano in Cape Breton, she learned to play the rhythms on a piece of board, and the fiddlers would all congregate to play on the cold winter's evenings and Mom would be banging on this board, so when they bought a piano, they bought it in Toronto and had it taken by train and brought in on a horse, a horse and sleigh to the house. (Applause) I like it. (Applause) (Laughter) DL: Oh yeah, okay, in my family we had seven girls, four boys, we had two fiddles and one piano, and of course we were all fighting to play on the instruments, so dad and mom set a rule that you couldn't kick anyone off the instrument. You had to wait until they were finished, so of course, what we would do is we'd get on the piano and you wouldn't even get off to eat, because you wouldn't want to give it up to your brother or sister, and they'd wait and wait and wait, and it'd be midnight and you'd be still sitting there on the piano, but it was their way to get us to practice.","Natalie MacMaster is from Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, eastern Canada.

360,"Well, Don Brownlee, my friend, and I finally got to the point where we got tired of turning on the TV and seeing the spaceships and seeing the aliens every night, and tried to write a counter-argument to it, and put out what does it really take for an Earth to be habitable, for a planet to be an Earth, to have a place where you could probably get not just life, but complexity, which requires a huge amount of evolution, and therefore constancy of conditions. If you go back two billion years, you're not on an Earth-like planet any more. It was, ""It burns! And I really do think we have to start thinking about what's a good planet and what isn't. Now, I throw this slide up because it indicates to me that, even if SETI does hear something, can we figure out what they said? Because this was a slide that was passed between the two major intelligences on Earth -- a Mac to a PC -- and it can't even get the letters right -- (Laughter) -- so how are we going to talk to the aliens? And that will happen, paradoxically -- everything you hear about global warming -- when we hit CO2 down to 10 parts per million, we are no longer going to have to have plants that are allowed to have any photosynthesis, and there go animals. The effects of it spread this very thin impact layer all over the planet, and we had very quickly the death of the dinosaurs, the death of these beautiful ammonites, Leconteiceras here, and Celaeceras over here, and so much else. Something else is, because if that doesn't survive, we are not here; there are no mammals. And the what, I think, is that we returned, over and over again, to the Pre-Cambrian world, that first microbial age, and the microbes are still out there. And here's the weapon, it seems, that it did so over the last 500 million years. This is a view of the Earth now, if we extract a lot of it. So, these are new data Rob Berner and I -- from Yale -- put together, and what we try to do now is track the amount of carbon dioxide in the entire rock record --   and we can do this from a variety of means -- and put all the red lines here, when these -- what I call greenhouse mass extinctions -- took place.

362,"This is a wheat bread, a whole wheat bread, and it's made with a new technique that I've been playing around with, and developing and writing about which, for lack of a better name, we call the epoxy method. They like to eat healthy and healthily, but when we think of something as a health food, we think of it as something we eat out of obligation, not out of passion and love for the flavor. And -- and you can get somebody to eat something that's good for them once, but they won't eat it again if they don't like it, right? So, this is the challenge for this bread. We're going to try this at lunch, and I'll explain a bit more about it, but it's made not only with two types of pre-doughs -- this attempt, again, at bringing out flavor is to make a piece of dough the day before that is not leavened. And it's made -- it can be a sourdough starter, or what we call a ""biga"" or any other kind of pre-fermented dough with a little yeast in it, and that starts to develop flavor also. And we're hoping that, sort of, the enzyme piece of dough becomes the fuel pack for the leavened piece of dough, and when we put them together and add the final ingredients, we can create a bread that does evoke the full potential of flavor trapped in the grain. And somehow, this is transformed -- the yeast burps and sweats are later transformed -- and this is really getting to the heart of what makes bread so special is that it is a transformational food, and we're going to explore that in a minute. And at stage nine we get the dough to the final shape, and it goes into the oven -- stage 10. And so, we're going to be on our own journey today from wheat to eat, and in a few minutes we will try this, and see if we have succeeded in fulfilling this baker's mission of pulling out flavor. In stage two, we add water and salt to it, mix it together, and we create something that we call ""clay."" And at stage 10, we take it to the oven. But dough is what we're working with, and we take that dough to the oven, and it goes into the oven. And it's what comes out of the oven that is what we call the staff of life.

How is it that they do that? But if we want to go deeper, of course, we need another gas supply, and helium is what we really need to go deep. That's what we use to inject, as we start to do our deep dives. We also have a second oxygen cylinder, solely as a backup; if there's a problem with our first oxygen supply, we can continue to breathe. You need three, so if one goes bad, you know which one it is.

Now, think about where the world would be today   if we had the light bulb, but you couldn't focus light; if when you turned one on it just went wherever it wanted to. Now, after almost 80 years of having sound, I thought it was about time that we figure out a way to put sound where you want to. (Applause) Because I have some limited time, I'll cut it off for a second, and tell you about how it works and what it's good for. We're just starting. And, you know, if the sound isn't there, the sale typically isn't made. For instance, like, when you're on an airplane, they show the movie, you get to watch it for free; when you want to hear the sound, you pay. But what's great about it, from the tests that have been done, is, if you don't want to hear it, you take about one step to the side and you don't hear it. If you're interested in what it costs -- I'm not selling them today -- but this unit, with the electronics and everything, if you buy one, is around a thousand bucks. And the sound that you're hearing, unlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is made on the face, is made out in front of it, in the air. So, again, this idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want to is really starting to catch on. So it allows you to go nearly a mile away and communicate with people, and there can be a public beach just off to the side, and they don't even know it's turned on. We put it on a turret with a camera, so that when they shoot at you, you're over there, and it's there. So, I've been really lucky as an inventor. I usually figure out what my talk is when I get up in front of a group.","I'm going to play it for you in a couple minutes,   but I want to make an analogy before I do  to this.

367,"And I heard that they do these track meets with all disabled runners, and I figured, ""Oh, I don't know about this, but before I judge it, let me go see what it's all about."" AM: Yes, well, you know, I'd won everything as far as the disabled meets -- everything I competed in -- and, you know, training in Georgetown and knowing that I was going to have to get used to   seeing the backs of all these women's shirts -- you know, I'm running against the next Flo-Jo -- and they're all looking at me like, ""Hmm, what's, you know, what's going on here?""

368,"And Warren Buffet had recommended I do that -- being honest about what was going well, what wasn't, and making it kind of an annual thing. A goal I had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems, because I think there are some very important problems that don't get worked on naturally. And only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and draw other people in can we make as much progress as we need to. And the disease was all over the world. And this is: How do you make a teacher great? I had great teachers. They've gone back and they've gotten their Master's of Education. That bottom thing, which says there's no effect at all, is a master's degree. There are some people who are very good at this. And we've done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in and to replicate it, to raise the average capability -- or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system. So imagine running a factory where you've got these workers, some of them just making crap and the management is told, ""Hey, you can only come down here once a year, but you need to let us know, because we might actually fool you, and try and do a good job in that one brief moment.""

369,"(Music) Jose Antonio Abreu: My dear friends, ladies and gentlemen, I am overjoyed today at being awarded the TED Prize on behalf of all the distinguished music teachers, artists and educators from Venezuela who have selflessly and loyally accompanied me for 35 years in founding, growing and developing in Venezuela the National System of Youth and Children's Orchestras and Choirs. All my life I've dreamed that all Venezuelan children have the same opportunity that I had. When I arrived at the rehearsal, only 11 kids had shown up, and I said to myself, ""Do I close the program or multiply these kids?"" I decided to face the challenge, and on that same night, I promised those 11 children I'd turn our orchestra into one of the leading orchestras in the world. In its essence, the orchestra and the choir are much more than artistic structures. Child: After all this time here, music is life. Music is life. With his effort, and the support of his mother, his family and his community, he became a principal member in the double bass segment of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. He was the conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra, and he's an unbeatable example for young musicians in Latin America and the world. In the personal/social circle, the children in the orchestras and choirs develop their intellectual and emotional side. The child becomes a role model for both his parents, and this is very important for a poor child. It's what makes a child play a violin at home, while his father works in his carpentry. Not an economic or social crisis, but a spiritual one. We hope that TED can contribute in a full and fundamental way to the building of this new era in the teaching of music, in which the social, communal, spiritual and vindicatory aims of the child and the adolescent become a beacon and a goal for a vast social mission.

370,"Fifty years ago, when I began exploring the ocean, no one -- not Jacques Perrin, not Jacques Cousteau or Rachel Carson -- imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it or by what we took out of it. I want to share with you my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us, and to consider why it matters that in 50 years, we've lost -- actually, we've taken, we've eaten -- more than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea; why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared; why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the Pacific should concern not only the creatures that are dying, but it really should concern you. We need to learn everything we can about it and do everything we can to take care of it. If you think the ocean isn't important, imagine Earth without it. Yet we have this idea, we humans, that the Earth -- all of it: the oceans, the skies -- are so vast and so resilient it doesn't matter what we do to it. Since then, I've had the great pleasure of working with the Googlers, with DOER Marine, with National Geographic, with dozens of the best institutions and scientists around the world, ones that we could enlist, to put the ocean in Google Earth. Consider this: Starting right here at the convention center, we can find the nearby aquarium, we can look at where we're sitting, and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium, the ocean, and California's four national marine sanctuaries, and the new network of state marine reserves that are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets We can flit over to Hawaii and see the real Hawaiian Islands: not just the little bit that pokes through the surface, but also what's below. All of these parts are part of our life support system. This is the consequence of not knowing that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea. There are still some blue whales. Imagine what that means to our life support system. The good news is that there are now more than 4,000 places in the sea, around the world, that have some kind of protection. With scientists around the world, I've been looking at the 99 percent of the ocean that is open to fishing -- and mining, and drilling, and dumping, and whatever -- to search out hope spots, and try to find ways to give them and us a secure future. We need to do for the ocean what Al Gore did for the skies above.

371,"And I'm like, ""I don't know what just happened, but there are testicles in this bucket, and that's not how we do it."" We're on twice a day on the Discovery -- we can't do this."" He's like, ""A day?"" And I can't get this thought out of my head, and I can't get that vision out of my sight, so I did what I had to do. And this metaphor in my head -- I've got anagnorisis and peripeteia on my chin -- (Laughter) I've got to tell you, it's such a great device, though. And I've been having them, over 200 dirty jobs, I have them all the time, but that one -- that one drilled something home in a way that I just wasn't prepared for. I do, but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong; some of the other notions of work that I've just been assuming are sacrosanct, and they're not. I didn't know what to do with my life, but I was told if you follow your passion, it's going to work out. I mean -- this is heresy, what I'm about to say -- but what if it's really safety third? What I mean to say is: I value my safety on these crazy jobs as much as the people that I'm working with, but the ones who really get it done -- they're not out there talking about safety first. We try hard on ""Dirty Jobs"" not to do that, which is why I do the work and I don't cheat. And I realized, probably too late in this game -- I hope not, because I don't know if I can do 200 more of these things -- but we're going to do as many as we can. And to me, the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with, is that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things, not just the testicles on my chin. So, if I were running for anything -- and I'm not -- I would simply say that the jobs we hope to make and the jobs we hope to create aren't going to stick unless they're jobs that people want.

372,"I'm not going to talk too long about it, but there are so many of the family of Uce, which are not so fortunate to live out there in the forest, that still have to go through that process. So I decided that I had to come up with a solution for her but also a solution that will benefit the people that are trying to exploit those forests, to get their hands on the last timber and that are causing, in that way, the loss of habitat and all those victims. So I created the place Samboja Lestari, and the idea was, if I can do this on the worst possible place that I can think of where there is really nothing left, no one will have an excuse to say, ""Yeah, but ..."" No. We had slash and burn agriculture; people cannot afford the fertilizer, so they burn the trees and have the minerals available there; the fires become more frequent, and after a while you're stuck with an area of land where there is no fertility left. Still, in this place, in this grassland where you can see our very first office there on that hill, four years later, there is this one green blop on the Earth's surface ... (Applause) And there are all these animals, and all these people happy, and there's this economic value. If you can drop this recipe on the map on a sandy soil, on a clay soil, on a steep slope, on flat soil, you put those different recipes; if you combine them, out of that comes a business plan, comes a work plan, and you can optimize it for the amount of labor you have available or for the amount of fertilizer you have, and you can do it. So you have to do it with the local people. It's not that simple, and you have to work with the people. That you can go from this zero situation, by planting the vegetables and the trees, or directly, the trees in the lines in that grass there, putting up the buffer zone, producing your compost, and then making sure that at every stage of that up growing forest there are crops that can be used. We plant in the seedlings mixed with the bananas, the papayas, all the crops for the local people, but the trees are growing up fast in between as well. And all these species and income. If you look at rainfall, it was already up 20 percent at that time. We have the zone with the sugar palms, and then we have this fence with very thorny palms to keep the orangutans -- that we provide with a place to live in the middle -- and the people apart. In summary, if you look at it, in year one the people can sell their land to get income, but they get jobs back in the construction and the reforestation, the working with the orangutans, and they can use the waste wood to make handicraft. They also get free land in between the trees, where they can grow their crops.","I decided that I had to come up with a solution for her but also a solution that will benefit the people that are trying to exploit those forests.

373,"I want to turn everything we know right now about detecting viruses and the spectrum of viruses that are out there into, let's say, a small chip. Now, by the time we get out here to, let's say, acute bee paralysis virus -- probably a bad one to have if you're a bee --- this virus shares almost no similarity to coxsackievirus, but I can guarantee you that the sequences that are most conserved  among these viruses on the right-hand of the screen are in identical regions right up here. OK, so that's what we did, but how are we going to do that? We took our chip over to Hewlett-Packard and used their atomic force microscope on one of these spots, and this is what you see: you can actually see the strands of DNA lying flat on the glass here.

Well, we just put basically all the human respiratory viruses on one chip, and we threw in herpes virus for good measure -- I mean, why not? Rhino's the common cold, and you all know what polio is, and you can see that these signatures are distinct. Now, this is kind of a cheap shot, because I know what the genetic sequence of all these rhinoviruses is, and I in fact designed the chip expressly to be able to tell them apart, but what about rhinoviruses that have never seen a genetic sequencer? Well, first of all, when you have a big chip like this, you need a little bit more informatics, so we designed the system to do automatic diagnosis. But we can get virtual patterns, and compare them to our observed result -- which is a very complex mixture -- and come up with some sort of score of how likely it is this is a rhinovirus or something. We put it on the chip; what do we see? What is that? And what I'm telling you here from the signal, is that men who have a mutation in this antiviral defense enzyme, and have a tumor, often have -- 40 percent of the time -- a signature which reveals a new retrovirus. What is it? Is it the case that these guys are just more susceptible to viruses?","I want to turn everything we know right now about detecting viruses and the spectrum of viruses that are out there into, let's say, a small chip.

374,"And it was very difficult for me to imagine how to paint pictures that were based on Piero until I realized that I could look at Piero as nature -- that I would have the same attitude towards looking at Piero della Francesca as I would if I were looking out a window at a tree. Perhaps it's not a very insightful observation, but that really started me on a path to be able to do a kind of theme and variations based on a work by Piero, in this case that remarkable painting that's in the Uffizi, ""The Duke of Montefeltro,"" who faces his consort, Battista. On another subject -- (Laughter) -- I was driving in the country one day with my wife, and I saw this sign, and I said, ""That is a fabulous piece of design."" I said, ""Well, it's so persuasive, because the purpose of that sign is to get you into the garage, and since most people are so suspicious of garages, and know that they're going to be ripped off, they use the word 'reliable.'

375,"For many millennia, humans have been on a journey to find answers, answers to questions about naturalism and transcendence, about who we are and why we are, and of course, who else might be out there. (Laughter) But, what if we're not? So, what exactly is SETI? Now, we can use the tools of the 21st century to try and observe what is, rather than ask what should be, believed. Our sun is one of 400 billion stars in our galaxy, and we know that many other stars have planetary systems. Well, what about 10^22? And the nearest star is 4.2 light years away, which means its light takes 4.2 years to get here. It tells us about their past, but detection of a signal tells us it's possible for us to have a long future. And the other thing that one should take away from this chart is the very narrow range of time over which humans can claim to be the dominant intelligence on the planet. We are residents of one small planet in a corner of the Milky Way galaxy. We are a small part of the story of cosmic evolution, and we are going to be responsible for our continued participation in that story, and perhaps SETI will help as well.

376,"I was pre-med at the time, and I thought I would become a surgeon because I was interested in anatomy and dissecting animals really piqued my curiosity. At the same time, I fell in love with New York City. Then I started going into the tunnels, which made me realize that there's a whole new dimension to the city that I never saw before and most people don't get to see. So I wanted to create a fictional character or an animal that dwells in these underground spaces, and the simplest way to do it, at the time, was to model myself. I was very fond of this space because it's the first massive industrial complex I found on my own that is abandoned.

And I'd like to just tell you one of our projects, which is the generation of Canopy Confluences. What I do is I bring together scientists and artists of all kinds, and we spend a week in the forest on these little platforms; and we look at nature, we look at trees, we look at the canopy, and we communicate, and exchange, and express what we see together. What can I, as an ecologist, do about that? Well, my thought was that I could learn how to grow mosses, and that way we wouldn't have to take them out of the wild. And I thought, if I had some partners that could help me with this, that would be great. Because the prison wardens were very enthusiastic about this as well, I started a Science and Sustainability Seminar in the prisons. Finally, as a scientist and as a person and now, as part of the TED community, I feel that I have better tools to go out to trees, to go out to forests, to go out to nature, to make new discoveries about nature -- and about humans' place in nature wherever we are and whomever you are.","I'd like to take you all on a journey up to the forest canopy, and share with you what canopy researchers are asking and also how they're communicating with other people outside of science.

378,"And the reason that that was the model    of beauty and of nature was because the decimal point had not been invented yet --    it wasn't the 16th century -- and everybody had to dimension a building    in terms of fractions, so a room would be dimensioned    as one-fourth of a facade; the structural dais of that might be dimensioned as 10 units, and you would get down to the small elements    by fractional subdivision:    finer and finer and finer. So, what's going on today    is that there's a model of natural form which is calculus-based    and which is using digital tools, and that has a lot of implications    to the way we think about beauty and form,    and it has a lot of implications in the way we think about nature. But what was important is,    the Gothic moment in architecture was the first time    that force and motion was thought of in terms of form. In all these examples,   there's one ideal form,   because these are thought in terms of structure. To just talk for a minute about the    digital mediums that we're using now    and how they integrate calculus: the fact that they're calculus-based    means that we don't have to think about dimension   in terms of ideal units    or discreet elements. Now, typically you'd think that they would all be the same:    like, the chairs you're sitting in would all be the same dimension. You know, I haven't verified this, but it's the norm    that every chair would be a slightly different dimension,    because you'd want to space them all out for everybody's sight lines. That's because we're all using calculus tools    for manufacturing and for design. It also is much more dynamic,    so that you can see that the same form opens and closes    in a very dynamic way as you move across it,    because it has this quality of vector in motion   built into it. I think that's one of the main changes,    also, in architecture:    that we're starting to look now not for some ideal form, like a Latin cross for a church,    but actually all the traits of a church:   so, light that comes from behind from an invisible source,   directionality that focuses you towards an altar. So, working with   Bentley and MicroStation,   we've written a custom piece of software    that networks all of the components together    into these chunks of information,    so that if we change any element    along the length of the building, not only does that change distribute    through each one of the trusses, but each one of the trusses then distributes that information    down the length of the entire facade of the building. So, for me, what was important is that    this coffee set -- which is just a coffee pot, a teapot,    and those are the pots sitting on a tray --    that they would have a coherence --   so, they would be Greg Lynn Alessi coffee pots --    but that everyone who bought one    would have a one-of-a-kind object that was unique in some way. Like, we have to design things which are coherent as a single object,   but also break down into small rooms    and have an identity of both the big scale   and the small scale. So, the pattern and the form aren't the same thing,    but they really work together and are fused   in some way. We really approached it at the level    of the typology of the building, where we could build these five separate towers,    but they would all join at the 60th floor    and make a kind of single monolithic mass.","The Gothic moment in architecture was the first time    that force and motion was thought of in terms of form.

379,"And so the next -- over the next six decades, believe it or not, I've built a number of aircraft, with the goal of creating something that could do for you, or me, what the hummingbird does, and give you that flexibility. In a helicopter you feel -- and it's still a remarkable sensation -- you feel like you're being hauled up from above by a vibrating crane. When you get in the Skycar -- and I can tell you, there's only one other person that's flown it, but he had the same sensation -- you really feel like you're being lifted up by a magic carpet, without any vibration whatsoever. I only get to fly this vehicle occasionally, and only when I can persuade my stockholders to let me do so, but it's still one of those wonderful experiences that reward you for all that time. If we can get rid of that, then the highways will now be useful to you, as contrasted by what's happening in many parts of the world today. On this next slide, is an interesting history of what we really have seen in infrastructure, because whether I give you a perfect Skycar, the perfect vehicle for use, it's going to have very little value to you unless you've got a system to use it in. I'm sure any of you have asked the question, yeah, are there great things up there -- what am I going to do, get up there? You're not going to be a pilot, you're going to be a passenger. Because if you're in this world, where computers are controlling what you're doing, it's going to be very critical that something can't fail on you. After all, if you can fly like that, why are you going to drive around on a highway? And I know the pilots in the audience aren't going to like that --  and I've had a lot of bad feedback from people who want to be up there, flying around and experiencing that. In that application, it generates one horsepower per pound, which is twice as good as your car engine today, but only half of what we need. And then you have three -- you still have the triple redundancy. (Laughter) I'd like to show you an animation in this next one, which is one element of the Skycar's use, but it's one that demonstrates how it could be used. If you can live 75 miles from San Francisco and get there in 15 minutes, you're going to sell your 700,000-dollar apartment, buy an upscale home on the side of a mountain, buy a Skycar, which I think would be priced at that time perhaps in the area of 100,000 dollars, put money in the bank ... that's a very significant incentive for getting out of San Francisco.","In a helicopter you feel -- and it's still a remarkable sensation -- you feel like you're being hauled up from above by a vibrating crane.

380,"But it would be worse, except for that I happen to remember that over 20 years ago, when I was a teenager, when I first started telling people that I wanted to be a writer, I was met with this same sort of fear-based reaction. It just didn't come up like that, you know? And so, it seems to me, upon a lot of reflection, that the way that I have to work now, in order to continue writing, is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct, right? I have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between me, as I am writing, and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be, from now on. They believed that a genius was this, sort of magical divine entity, who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist's studio, kind of like Dobby the house elf, and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work and would shape the outcome of that work. (Laughter) And this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time. You know, I think that allowing somebody, one mere person to believe that he or she is like, the vessel, you know, like the font and the essence and the source of all divine, creative, unknowable, eternal mystery is just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile, human psyche. (Laughter) So when I heard that I was like -- that's uncanny, that's exactly what my creative process is like. (Laughter) That's not at all what my creative process is -- I'm not the pipeline! It saved me when I was in the middle of writing ""Eat, Pray, Love,"" and I fell into one of those sort of pits of despair that we all fall into when we're working on something and it's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster, the worst book ever written. And I said aloud, ""Listen you, thing, you and I both know that if this book isn't brilliant that is not entirely my fault, right? Because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this, I don't have any more than this. But if you don't do that, you know what, the hell with it. And I know you know what I'm talking about, because I know you've all seen, at some point in your life, a performance like this.

When you ask the janitors who behaved like the ones I described how hard it is to learn to do their job, they tell you that it takes lots of experience.

382,"I'm hired to be solemn, but I find more and more that I'm solemn when I don't have to be. And what -- the way I looked at design and the way I looked at the world was, what was going on around me and the things that came at the time I walked into design were the enemy. And to do stuff that wasn't made out of Helvetica was actually kind of hard because you had to find it. And I taught myself design this way, and this was sort of my early years, and I used these things in really goofy ways on record covers and in my design. And first I was praised for it, then criticized for it, but the fact of the matter was, I had become solemn. I didn't do what I think was a piece of serious work again for about 14 years. I spent most of the '80s being quite solemn, turning out these sorts of designs that I was expected to do because that's who I was, and I was living in this cycle of going from serious to solemn to hackneyed to dead, and getting rediscovered all over again. And I think that you know when you're going to be given this position, and it's rare, but when you get it and you have this opportunity, it's the moment of serious play. So, I changed it so that every season was different, and I continued to do these posters, but they never had the seriousness of the first identity because they were too individual, and they didn't have that heft of everything being the same thing. I didn't know how to read an architectural plan, I didn't know what they were talking about, and I really couldn't handle the fact that a job -- a single job -- could go on for four years because I was used to immediacy in graphic design, and that kind of attention to detail was really bad for somebody like me, with ADD. And it was serious play. This is the building that -- they had no money, and they had to recast it, and they said, if we give you 100,000 dollars, what can you do with it?

I've heard what I consider an extraordinary thing that I've only heard a little bit in the two previous TEDs, and what that is is an interweaving and an interlarding, an intermixing, of a sense of social responsibility in so many of the talks -- global responsibility, in fact, appealing to enlightened self-interest, but it goes far beyond enlightened self-interest. One of the most impressive things about what some, perhaps 10, of the speakers have been talking about is the realization, as you listen to them carefully, that they're not saying: Well, this is what we should do; this is what I would like you to do. It's: This is what I have done because I'm excited by it, because it's a wonderful thing, and it's done something for me and, of course, it's accomplished a great deal.

385,"Right when I was 15 was when I first got interested in solar energy. I wasn't able to keep up with the business, and I ended up with a 25-year detour. What if we collect the sun with a large reflector -- like I had been thinking about in high school, but maybe with modern technology we could make it cheaper -- concentrate it to a small converter, and then the conversion device wouldn't have to be as expensive, because it's much smaller, rather than solar cells, which have to cover the entire surface that you want to gather sun from. And I'll show you what we came up with. So we tried to look at all the different heat engines that have been used in history to convert sunlight or heat to electricity, And one of the great ones of all time, James Watt's steam engine of 1788 was a major breakthrough. So, once you have mobility, you're making a lot of engines because you've got lots of units, as opposed to steam ships or big factories, so this was the engine that ended up benefiting from mass production where all the other engines didn't. So we tried to look at the Stirling engine in a new way, because it was practical -- weight no longer mattered for our application. So this is the engine. So you have the engine. This is what the first prototype of our system looked like with the petals and the engine in the center. So this is a unit with the 12 petals. But you can use it to optionally heat hot water and that brings the efficiency up even higher because some of the heat that you'd normally be rejecting, you can now use as useful energy, whether it's for a pool or hot water. So you don't have to just have a feel-good attitude about energy to want to have one of these. It's been pounded for a billion years with a lot of energy to make it have all that energy contained in it. And it would be great if we could make our energy usage renewable, where as we're using the energy, we're creating it at the same pace, and I really hope we can get there.","""I wasn't able to keep up with the business, and I ended up with a 25-year detour.

So we decided to cast a series of little people that would play the different bodies of Benjamin at the different increments of his life and that we would in fact create a computer-generated version of Brad's head, aged to appear as Benjamin, and attach that to the body of the real actor. Of course, this was the Holy Grail of our industry, and the fact that this guy is a global icon didn't help either, because I'm sure if any of you ever stand in line at the grocery store, you know -- we see his face constantly. And it's not a special effects film; it has to be a man. (Laughter) So we had a big problem: we didn't know how we were going to do this.

He needed to be able to walk in broad daylight, at nighttime, under candlelight, he had to hold an extreme close-up, he had to deliver dialogue, he had to be able to run, he had to be able to sweat, he had to be able to take a bath, to cry, he even had to throw up.

Here are the 1,100 bottle caps they collected. I separated them by color and put them on display the next Earth Day at Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro. And this. Now, how do we analyze samples like this one that contain more plastic than plankton? We simply cannot store and maintain or recycle all our stuff. Now, the market can do a lot for us, but it can't fix the natural system in the ocean we've broken. Straining the ocean for plastic would be beyond the budget of any country and it might kill untold amounts of sea life in the process.","Plastics are hard to recycle. melting point has a lot to do with this.

388,"One of the guys I hired was an engineer named Jack Dorsey, and a year later, when we were trying to decide which way to go with Odeo, Jack presented an idea he'd been tinkering around with for a number of years that was based around sending simple status updates to friends. Now, it's hard to justify doing a side project at a startup, where focus is so critical, but I had actually launched Blogger as a side project to my previous company, thinking it was just a little thing we'd do on the side, and it ended up taking over not only the company, but my life for the next five or six years. You say what you're doing in 140 characters or less, and people who are interested in you get those updates. And in my case, when I hit send, up to 60,000 people will receive that message in a matter of seconds. What we didn't anticipate was the many, many other uses that would evolve from this very simple system. When the wildfires broke out in San Diego, in October of 2007, people turned to Twitter to report what was happening and to find information from neighbors about what was happening around them. At this event, dozens of people here are Twittering and thousands of people around the world are following along because they want to know what it feels like to be here and what's happening. As have this guy's. Twitter was originally designed as a broadcast medium: you send one message and it goes out to everybody, and you receive the messages you're interested in. And they tapped into the fact that, if you have millions of people around the world talking about what they're doing and what's around them, you have an incredible resource to find out about any topic or event while it's going on. This is another way that our mind was shifted, and Twitter wasn't what we thought it was. This not only lets you view Twitters in different ways, but it introduces new use cases as well. ""Evan Williams, give people more good ways to share information and follow your hunch at TED."" ""Evan Williams is just dying on stage here at TED. So, thank you very much, Evan.","Twitter was founded as a side project for founder and CEO of Blogger. Twitter has become a hugely popular social network.

389,"So, as a computer scientist inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects -- along with my adviser Pattie, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi -- I started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer, instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip moving around a flat desktop, what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically, arranging it the way we wanted? And as these tools become more physical, more aware of their motion, aware of each other, and aware of the nuance of how we move them, we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles. This Siftable is configured to show video, and if I tilt it in one direction, it'll roll the video this way; if I tilt it the other way it rolls it backwards. So in this case, we've got three Siftables configured to be paint buckets and I can use them to pour color into that central one, where they get mixed. So here I'm -- (Applause) This is a Fibonacci sequence that I'm making with a simple equation program. (Applause) So these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab, and I managed to get them to try it out, and shoot a video. And, one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people many instructions. And he can bring new characters into the scene, just by lifting the Siftables off the table that have that character shown on them. Video: Hello! And you can inject these sounds into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want. You attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it. Video: (Music) DM: And now I'll attach the filter to the drums, so I can control the effect live. Video: (Music) DM: And now I'll attach the filter to the bass for some more expression. And today, I had time to show you one point in this new design space, and a few of the possibilities that we're working to bring out of the laboratory. So the thought I want to leave you with is that we're on the cusp of this new generation of tools for interacting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms.","As these tools become more physical, more aware of their motion, aware of each other, and aware of the nuance of how we move them, we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles.

390,"(Laughter) Yeah, people used to say, ""Norman's OK, but if you followed what he said, everything would be usable but it would be ugly."" Well, I didn't have that in mind, so ... This is neat. And I haven't the slightest idea of what it does or what it's good for, but I want it. It's so much fun I have it in my house -- but I have it in the entryway, I don't use it to make juice. And I can tell you stories about it, which makes it reflective, and so you'll see I have a theory of emotion. And if you look at the inside of the car -- I mean, I loved it, I wanted to see it, I rented it, this is me taking a picture while my son is driving -- and the inside of the car, the whole design is fun. So that's my new life; it's all about fun. But in fact, if that's how you always were you'd never get any work done because you'd be working along and say, ""Oh, I got a new way of doing it."" Most of what we do is subconscious. That's kind of what the teapot looks like but the way you use it is you lay it on its back, and you put tea in, and then you fill it with water. And when it's finished, you put it vertically, and now the tea is -- you remember -- above this line and the water only comes to here -- and so it keeps the tea out. Cognition is about understanding the world, emotion is about interpreting it -- saying good, bad, safe, dangerous, and getting us ready to act, which is why the muscles tense or relax. And the third level is reflective, which is, if you like the superego, it's a little part of the brain that has no control over what you do, no control over the -- doesn't see the senses, doesn't control the muscles. And what's neat is sometimes you pit one emotion against the other, the visceral fear of falling against the reflective state saying, ""It's OK.","Norman's new life is all about fun.

391,"I've been intrigued by this question of whether we could evolve or develop a sixth sense -- a sense that would give us seamless access and easy access to meta-information or information that may exist somewhere that may be relevant to help us make the right decision about whatever it is that we're coming across. When you meet someone here at TED -- and this is the top networking place, of course, of the year -- you don't shake somebody's hand and then say, ""Can you hold on for a moment while I take out my phone and Google you?"" Or when you go to the supermarket and you're standing there in that huge aisle of different types of toilet papers, you don't take out your cell phone, and open a browser, and go to a website to try to decide which of these different toilet papers is the most ecologically responsible purchase to make. I'm actually wearing the device right now and we've sort of cobbled it together with components that are off the shelf -- and that, by the way, only cost 350 dollars at this point in time. And in the video here we see my student Pranav Mistry, who's really the genius who's been implementing and designing this whole system. And we see how this system lets him walk up to any surface and start using his hands to interact with the information that is projected in front of him. But if you want a more stylish version, you could also paint your nails in different colors. And the camera basically tracks these four fingers and recognizes any gestures that he's making so he can just go to, for example, a map of Long Beach, zoom in and out, etc. Another even more important difference is that in mass production, this would not cost more tomorrow than today's cell phones and would actually not sort of be a bigger packaging -- could look a lot more stylish than this version that I'm wearing around my neck. But other than letting some of you live out your fantasy of looking as cool as Tom Cruise in ""Minority Report,"" the reason why we're really excited about this device is that it really can act as one of these sixth-sense devices that gives you relevant information about whatever is in front of you. Some of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it rather than the most ecologically responsible choice. (Laughter) If he picks up a book in the bookstore, he can get an Amazon rating -- it gets projected right on the cover of the book. If he turns to a particular page, he finds an annotation by maybe an expert or a friend of ours that gives him a little bit of additional information about whatever is on that particular page. (Laughter) As you interact with someone at TED, maybe you can see a word cloud of the tags, the words that are associated with that person in their blog and personal web pages. And, if you need to know what the current time is, it's as simple as drawing a watch -- (Laughter) (Applause) on your arm.","I've been intrigued by this question of whether we could evolve or develop a sixth sense.

392,"I was speaking to a group of about 300 kids, ages six to eight, at a children's museum, and I brought with me a bag full of legs, similar to the kinds of things you see up here, and had them laid out on a table for the kids. The doors open, the kids descend on this table of legs, and they are poking and prodding, and they're wiggling toes, and they're trying to put their full weight on the sprinting leg to see what happens with that. (Laughter) And just like that, I went from being a woman that these kids would have been trained to see as ""disabled"" to somebody that had potential that their bodies didn't have yet. And there's been a lot of talk about how life-changing this conference is for both speakers and attendees, and I am no exception. So at the time, it was my opportunity to put a call out to innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic community to come bring their talent to the science and to the art of building legs. And the conversation would go something like this, ""You know Aimee, you're very attractive. You don't look disabled."" (Laughter) I thought, ""Well, that's amazing, because I don't feel disabled."" It can transform the thing that might have made people fearful into something that invites them to look, and look a little longer, and maybe even understand. (Laughter) And then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these -- look like jellyfish legs, also polyurethane. Today, I have over a dozen pair of prosthetic legs that various people have made for me, and with them I have different negotiations of the terrain under my feet, and I can change my height -- I have a variable of five different heights. And I had these legs made a little over a year ago at Dorset Orthopedic in England and when I brought them home to Manhattan, my first night out on the town, I went to a very fancy party.

393,"Any of you who've been to Africa or had a junkyard dog come after you, there is a fixed kind of predatory gaze that you know you're in trouble. They're in a state of play. And social play is part of what we're about here today, and is a byproduct of the play scene. But take a look at the face and the body language of everybody in this fuzzy picture, and you can get a sense that they're all at play. So what does play do for the brain? And that's part of what the National Institute for Play is all about. I think we've got a lot of learning to do. Now, there is a way of looking at play that I also want to emphasize here, which is the play history. He had the expectations of his senatorial father and Washington, D.C. And although I think he certainly had the capacity for play -- because I do know something about that -- he wasn't as empowered, I think, as he now is by paying attention to what is his own passion and his own inner drive, which I think has its basis in all of us in our play history. So what I would encourage on an individual level to do, is to explore backwards as far as you can go to the most clear, joyful, playful image that you have, whether it's with a toy, on a birthday or on a vacation. But it doesn't have to be that way. (Applause) John Hockenberry: So it sounds to me like what you're saying is that there may be some temptation on the part of people to look at your work and go -- I think I've heard this, in my kind of pop psychological understanding of play, that somehow, the way animals and humans deal with play, is that it's some sort of rehearsal for adult activity. If you stop a cat from playing -- which you can do, and we've all seen how cats bat around stuff -- they're just as good predators as they would be if they hadn't played. So it's not just something you do in your spare time.

394,"There is still a huge frustration that people have because we haven't got data on the web as data. It had underground all the data OK, data is brown and boxy and boring, and that's how we think of it, isn't it? So I want us now to think about not just two pieces of data being connected, or six like he did, but I want to think about a world where everybody has put data on the web and so virtually everything you can imagine is on the web and then calling that linked data. If you want to put something on the web there are three rules: first thing is that those HTTP names -- those things that start with ""http:"" -- we're using them not just for documents now, we're using them for things that the documents are about. Second rule, if I take one of these HTTP names and I look it up and I do the web thing with it and I fetch the data using the HTTP protocol from the web, I will get back some data in a standard format which is kind of useful data that somebody might like to know about that thing, about that event. So I look up a person -- I can look up then the city where they were born; then I can look up the region it's in, and the town it's in, and the population of it, and so on. It's not just a root supplying a plant, but for each of those plants, whatever it is -- a presentation, an analysis, somebody's looking for patterns in the data -- they get to look at all the data and they get it connected together, and the really important thing about data is the more things you have to connect together, the more powerful it is. It's a really important thing that the web allows you to put all kinds of data up there. So it is with data. In fact, I'll just go into one area -- if you're looking at Alzheimer's, for example, drug discovery -- there is a whole lot of linked data which is just coming out because scientists in that field realize this is a great way of getting out of those silos, because they had their genomics data in one database in one building, and they had their protein data in another. Now if I go on like this, you'll think that all the data comes from huge institutions and has nothing to do with you. That's data. And that is what linked data is all about. So, we're at the stage now where we have to do this -- the people who think it's a great idea. And all the people -- and I think there's a lot of people at TED who do things because -- even though there's not an immediate return on the investment because it will only really pay off when everybody else has done it -- they'll do it because they're the sort of person who just does things which would be good if everybody else did them.","There is still a huge frustration that people have because we haven't got data on the web as data.

395,"Iâ€™m going around the world giving talks about Darwin, and usually what Iâ€™m talking about is Darwinâ€™s strange inversion of reasoning. ""In the theory with which we have to deal, Absolute Ignorance is the artificer; so that we may enunciate as the fundamental principle of the whole system, that, in order to make a perfect and beautiful machine, it is not requisite to know how to make it. It stands to reason that we love chocolate cake because it is sweet. It is. Honey is sweet because we like it, not ""we like it because honey is sweet."" You have to look in our brains to understand why theyâ€™re sweet. So if you think first there was sweetness, and then we evolved to like sweetness, youâ€™ve got it backwards; thatâ€™s just wrong. And itâ€™s a good thing that there isnâ€™t, because if there were, then Mother Nature would have a problem: How on earth do you get chimps to mate? Thatâ€™s all there is to it. What we see with, say, chocolate cake is itâ€™s a supernormal stimulus to tweak our design wiring. And there are lots of supernormal stimuli; chocolate cake is one. But now, if babies didnâ€™t look the way they do -- if babies looked like this, thatâ€™s what we would find adorable, thatâ€™s what we would find -- we would think, oh my goodness, do I ever want to hug that.

396,"Do you rip it off quickly -- short duration but high intensity -- or do you take your Band-Aid off slowly -- you take a long time, but each second is not as painful -- which one of those is the right approach? They told me that they had the right model of the patient -- that they knew what was the right thing to do to minimize my pain -- and they also told me that the word patient doesn't mean to make suggestions or to interfere or ... And, you know, there's not much -- there wasn't much I could do, and they kept on doing what they were doing. And one of the most interesting lessons I learned was that there is an experimental method that if you have a question you can create a replica of this question in some abstract way, and you can try to examine this question, maybe learn something about the world. So that's what I did. And I would bring people to the lab and I would put their finger in it, and I would crunch it a little bit. And when I finished hurting people a little bit, I would ask them, so, how painful was this? If you were in the experiment, I would pass you a sheet of paper with 20 simple math problems that everybody could solve, but I wouldn't give you enough time. So, maybe what is happening is that there's a level of cheating we can't go over, but we can still benefit from cheating at a low degree, as long as it doesn't change our impressions about ourselves.

397,"And I thought to myself, wouldn't it be great if I had my own dodo skeleton?

Russian nuclear launch key: The one on the top is the picture of the one I found on eBay; the one on the bottom is the one I made for myself, because I couldn't afford the one on eBay. And I didn't mean to continue, I -- it's kind of like, you know, you can only clean a super messy room by picking up one thing at a time; you can't think about the totality. I don't have the room for this in my house, but I had to finish what I had started. But in this case, it's not about the author, it's not about the book or the movie or the story, it's about the object in and of itself. And then there is this fourth level, which is a whole new object in the world: the prop made for the movie, the representative of the thing, becomes, in its own right, a whole other thing, a whole new object of desire. I'd bought a replica, a really crappy replica, of the Maltese Falcon on eBay, and had downloaded enough pictures to actually have some reasonable reference. It was made out of resin, which wasn't a common material for movie props about the time the movie was made. It's funny to me that it took a while to authenticate it, because I can see it compared to this thing, and I can tell you -- it's real, it's the real thing, it's made from the exact same mold that this one is. But again, I am not a sculptor, and so I don't know a lot of the tricks, like, I don't know how my friend Mike gets beautiful, shiny surfaces with his Sculpey; I certainly wasn't able to get it. Now, the great thing about getting it to this point was that because in the movie, when they finally bring out the bird at the end, and they place it on the table, they actually spin it. I ended up with this: my Maltese Falcon. And I can state with authority at this point in time, when I'd finished it, of all of the replicas out there -- and there is a few -- this is by far the most accurate representation of the original Maltese Falcon than anyone has sculpted. So here I had this Falcon, and it was lovely.","""I don't have the room for this in my house, but I had to finish what I had started"" ""I've spent my life obsessed by objects and the stories that they tell, and this was the very latest one"" ""I am not a sculptor, and so I don't know a lot of the tricks,"" he says.

399,"Some 17 years ago, I became allergic to Delhi's air. With the help of IIT, TERI, and learnings from NASA, we discovered that there are three basic green plants, common green plants, with which we can grow all the fresh air we need indoors to keep us healthy. Areca palm is a plant which removes CO2 and converts it into oxygen. We need four shoulder-high plants per person, and in terms of plant care, we need to wipe the leaves every day in Delhi, and perhaps once a week in cleaner-air cities. The second plant is Mother-in-law's Tongue, which is again a very common plant, and we call it a bedroom plant, because it converts CO2 into oxygen at night. The third plant is money plant, and this is again a very common plant; preferably grows in hydroponics. With these three plants, you can grow all the fresh air you need. In fact, you could be in a bottle with a cap on top, and you would not die at all, and you would not need any fresh air. We have tried these plants at our own building in Delhi, which is a 50,000-square-feet, 20-year-old building. And the study showed that, compared to other buildings, there is a reduced incidence of eye irritation by 52 percent, respiratory systems by 34 percent, headaches by 24 percent, lung impairment by 12 percent and asthma by nine percent. And also a reduction in energy requirements in buildings by an outstanding 15 percent, because you need less fresh air. It is also important for the environment, because the world's energy requirements are expected to grow by 30 percent in the next decade. 40 percent of the world's energy is taken up by buildings currently, and 60 percent of the world's population will be living in buildings in cities with a population of over one million in the next 15 years. And there is a growing preference for living and working in air-conditioned places. (Applause)","Some 17 years ago, I became allergic to Delhi's air.

400,"If you're at all like me, this is what you do with the sunny summer weekends in San Francisco: you build experimental kite-powered hydrofoils capable of more than 30 knots. And you realize that there is incredible power in the wind, and it can do amazing things. But kites aren't just toys like this. Then of course, at the dawn of aviation, all of the great inventors of the time -- like Hargreaves, like Langley, even Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone, who was flying this kite -- were doing so in the pursuit of aviation. And a fabulous man called Miles Loyd who lives on the outskirts of San Francisco, wrote this seminal paper that was completely ignored in the Journal of Energy about how to use basically an airplane on a piece of string to generate enormous amounts of electricity. And they can now span up to three hundred feet at the hub height, but they can't really go a lot higher, and more height is where the more wind is, and more power -- as much as twice as much. And Al Gore has spoken to why we need to hit one of these targets, and in reality what that means is in the next 30 to 40 years, we have to make 10 trillion watts or more of new clean energy somehow. And here we're actually generating about 10 kilowatts -- so, enough to power probably five United States households -- with a kite not much larger than this piano. And it doesn't hurt to do it in a location like this either. So this is the equivalent for a kite flier of peeing in the snow -- that's tracing your name in the sky. And this is where we're actually going. That would be enough to power your cell phone. If you give me a 747, I'll make six megawatts, which is more than the largest wind turbines today.

404,"If this virus was in thousands of individuals at this point, why was it the case that it took us until 1984 to be able to discover this virus? Nevertheless, we spend the vast majority of our energy focused on this level of the pyramid, trying to tackle things that are already completely adapted to human beings, that are going to be very very difficult to address -- as we've seen in the case of HIV. OK, so this is a picture, and I'm going to show you some pictures now from the field. One of the things I want you to note from it is blood -- that you see a tremendous amount of blood contact. And ideally, this is going to allow us to catch these things early on, as they're moving over into human populations. And the basic objective of this work is not to just go out once and look at these individuals, but to establish thousands of individuals in these populations that we would monitor continuously on a regular basis. We would actually enlist them -- which we've done now -- to collect specimens from animals. When they sample from animals, they collect the blood on the filter paper and this allows us to identify yet-unknown viruses from exactly the right animals -- the ones that are actually being hunted. NW: OK, before I continue, I think it's important to take just a moment to talk about bush meat.

It's one that I think we all need to ask ourselves, which is, why we thought the responsibility rested with this individual here. Bush meat is one of the central crises, which is occurring in our population right now, in humanity, on this planet. But the reason I like to show the shot is because you can see that he's about to solve this problem.

405,"In those days, those days which exist for me only as the most elusive memory now, when often the first sound you'd hear in the morning would be a storm of birdsong, then the soft clop of the hooves of the horse hauling a milk wagon down your block, and the last sound at night as likely as not would be your father pulling up in his car, having worked late again, always late, and going heavily down to the cellar, to the furnace, to shake out the ashes and damp the draft before he came upstairs to fall into bed -- in those long-ago days, women, my mother, my friends' mothers, our neighbors, all the women I knew -- wore, often much of the day, what were called housedresses, cheap, printed, pulpy, seemingly purposefully shapeless light cotton shifts that you wore over your nightgown and, when you had to go look for a child, hang wash on the line, or run down to the grocery store on the corner, under a coat, the twisted hem of the nightgown always lank and yellowed, dangling beneath. More than the curlers some of the women seemed constantly to have in their hair in preparation for some great event -- a ball, one would think -- that never came to pass; more than the way most women's faces not only were never made up during the day, but seemed scraped, bleached, and, with their plucked eyebrows, scarily masklike; more than all that it was those dresses that made women so unknowable and forbidding, adepts of enigmas to which men could have no access, and boys no conception. In those days, one hid much else as well: grown men didn't embrace one another, unless someone had died, and not always then; you shook hands or, at a ball game, thumped your friend's back and exchanged blows meant to be codes for affection; once out of childhood you'd never again know the shock of your father's whiskers on your cheek, not until mores at last had evolved, and you could hug another man, then hold on for a moment, then even kiss (your fathers bristles white and stiff now). We knew so little in those days, as little as now, I suppose about healing those hurts: even the women, in their best dresses, with beads and sequins sewn on the bodices, even in lipstick and mascara, their hair aflow, could only stand wringing their hands, begging for peace, while father and son, like thugs, like thieves, like Romans, simmered and hissed and hated, inflicting sorrows that endured, the worst anyway, through the kiss and embrace, bleeding from brother to brother, into the generations.

A casual impulse, a fancy, never thought of until now, hardly thought of even now ... No, more than impulse or fancy, the girl knows what she's doing, the girl means something, the girl means to mean, because it occurs to her in that instant, that beautiful or not, bright yes or no, she's not who she is, she's not the person she is, and the reason, she suddenly knows, is that there's been so much premeditation where she is, so much plotting and planning, there's hardly a person where she is, or if there is, it's not her, or not wholly her, it's a self inhabited, lived in by her, and seemingly even as she thinks it she knows what's been missing: grace, not premeditation but grace, a kind of being in the world spontaneously, with grace.

408,"So looking at their three main markets for their product which were basically transportation design, interiors and furniture, we came up with the solution of taking an old Airstream trailer and gutting it, and trying to portray laminate, and a trailer, in kind of a fresh, new contemporary look. What I discovered in these interiors is that there was a disconnect between the exterior shell and the interior architecture of the pieces. That seemed really like a crisis to me, that they had never been able to develop a vocabulary about escape, and about travel, and modernity in this trailer that was consistent with the shell. We really needed to do some archeology in the trailer itself to figure out what's authentic in an Airstream trailer, and what feels like it has true purpose and utility. The biggest difficulty on one of these trailers is that when you're designing there's actually no logical place to stop and start materials because of the continuous form of the trailer. What I had to devise was a way of fooling the eye into believing that all these panels are curved with the shell. What I came up with was a series of second skins that basically float over the aluminum shell. And what I was trying to do there was direct your eye in the space, so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way, and that the casework wouldn't break up the space. Its a week of furniture design events in Tokyo, in October. Teruo Kurosaki, who owns a furniture company called Idee, he asked me to ship him two trailers to Tokyo. Trailer number two, you have a blank slate, you can to anything you want. They came to me and said, ""Well, what can we do to freshen this thing up? And I said, ""Well, not in that interior."" So the problem became -- and they set this dilemma to me -- that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology, and there's no money for tooling or molding. And there it is, that's the Bambi 16.","Airstream trailer interiors were gutted to create a fresh, new contemporary look.

409,"What we're going to do is actually just flash a series of photos behind me that show you the reality of robots used in war right now or already at the prototype stage. We now have 5,300. We now have 12,000. One of the people that I recently met with was an Air Force three-star general, and he said basically, where we're headed very soon is tens of thousands of robots operating in our conflicts, and these numbers matter, because we're not just talking about tens of thousands of today's robots, but tens of thousands of these prototypes and tomorrow's robots, because of course, one of the things that's operating in technology is Moore's Law, that you can pack in more and more computing power into those robots, and so flash forward around 25 years, if Moore's Law holds true, those robots will be close to a billion times more powerful in their computing than today. I've spent the last several years going around meeting with all the players in this field, from the robot scientists to the science fiction authors who inspired them to the 19-year-old drone pilots who are fighting from Nevada, to the four-star generals who command them, to even the Iraqi insurgents who they are targeting and what they think about our systems, and what I found interesting is not just their stories, but how their experiences point to these ripple effects that are going outwards in our society, in our law and our ethics, etc. So the first is that the future of war, even a robotics one, is not going to be purely an American one. We don't have a draft. And now we have the fact that we're converting more and more of our American soldiers that we would send into harm's way into machines, and so we may take those already lowering bars to war and drop them to the ground. The typical one that I was sent was an email that had an attachment of video of a Predator strike taking out an enemy site. But we have to remember, these are just the clips. Now the irony of all this is that while the future of war may involve more and more machines, it's our human psychology that's driving all of this, it's our human failings that are leading to these wars. One of the people I met with there was a news editor, and we're talking as a drone is flying above him, and this is what he had to say. They see an 80-year-old grandmother in a wheelchair the same way they see a T-80 tank: they're both just a series of zeroes and ones.

It is the capital of the country, and it took 23 years to build, which is something they seem to be very proud of over there. The building was finished in 1983.

And that really struck me about my father, in the sense that he had such belief that somehow, doing these things giving in the way that he gave, that something good would come out of it, even in the middle of a war, there was a war with Pakistan at one point, and the construction stopped totally and he kept working, because he felt, ""Well when the war is done they'll need this building."" And you know, when I knew him when I was in the office, he would come in from a trip, and he would be in the office for two or three days intensely, and he would pack up and go. You know he'd be in the office till three in the morning working with us and there was this kind of sense of the nomad in him. In that way it is so relevant. He paid his life for this, and that is why he is great and we'll remember him. In social aspect of his life he was just like a child, he was not at all matured. He could not say no to anything, and that is why, that he cannot say no to things, we got this building today. You see, only that way you can be able to understand him. But I think he has given us this building and we feel all the time for him, that's why, he has given love for us.","The film ends with a clip of my father, of Lou, talking about something that is very dear to him, which is the accidents of life.

411,"What I'm going to try to do is explain to you quickly how to predict, and illustrate it with some predictions about what Iran is going to do in the next couple of years. In order to look out for what's best for them or what they think is best for them, people have values -- they identify what they want, and what they don't want. And they have beliefs about what other people want, and what other people don't want, how much power other people have, how much those people could get in the way of whatever it is that you want. You know, what if people are rational? Now in order to work out what people are going to do to pursue their interests, we have to think about who has influence in the world. If we're looking at Iran, the president of the United States we would like to think, may have some influence -- certainly the president in Iran has some influence -- but we make a mistake if we just pay attention to the person at the top of the power ladder because that person doesn't know much about Iran, or about energy policy, or about health care, or about any particular policy. There are lots of people shaping decisions and so if we want to predict correctly we have to pay attention to everybody who is trying to shape the outcome, not just the people at the pinnacle of the decision-making pyramid. So I'm going to talk to you about how to process it, and I'm going to give you some examples out of Iran, and you're going to be wondering, ""Why should we listen to this guy? We need to know what they say they want, not what they want in their heart of hearts, not what they think they can get, but what they say they want, because that is a strategically chosen position, and we can work backwards from that to draw inferences about important features of their decision-making. So with just that little bit of input we can work out what the choices are that people have, what the chances are that they're willing to take, what they're after, what they value, what they want, and what they believe about other people. You might notice what we don't need to know: there's no history in here. How they got to where they are may be important in shaping the input information, but once we know where they are we're worried about where they're going to be headed in the future. If they don't know, who are the people trying to influence the decision, how much clout do they have, how much they care about this issue, and what do they say they want, are they experts? So you can see here on the vertical axis, I haven't shown it all the way down to zero, there are lots of other options, but here I'm just showing you the prediction, so I've narrowed the scale. BBM: Well, people of Iran, this is what many of you are going to evolve to want, and we could get there a lot sooner, and you would suffer a lot less trouble from economic sanctions, and we would suffer a lot less fear of the use of military force on our end, and the world would be a better place.","In order to look out for what's best for them, people have values.

412,"I know you guys think of yourself as humans, and this is sort of how I think of you. There's about a trillion human cells that make each one of us who we are and able to do all the things that we do. So there's all kinds of bacteria on the earth that have no business being in you or on you at any time, and if they are, they make you incredibly sick. And what we figured out is that the way they do that is they talk to each other, and they talk with a chemical language. But what it does do is to make and secrete small molecules that you can think of like hormones, and these are the red triangles. And it opens and closes the shutter so the amount of light coming out of the bottom, which is made by the bacterium, exactly matches how much light hits the squid's back, so the squid doesn't make a shadow. (Laughter) But then if you think about it, this squid has this terrible problem, because it's got this dying, thick culture of bacteria, and it can't sustain that. These are just like the receptors on the surfaces of your cells. Why this is interesting is because in the past decade, we have found that this is not just some anomaly of this ridiculous, glow-in-the-dark bacterium that lives in the ocean -- all bacteria have systems like this. But what they do, we now understand, is they get in you, they wait, they start growing, they count themselves with these little molecules, and they recognize when they have the right cell number that if all of the bacteria launch their virulence attack together, they're going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host. And then we started to look at other bacteria, and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we've discovered. And so we started to think, if this really is about communication in bacteria, and it's about counting your neighbors, it's not enough to be able to only talk within your species. They all have a species-specific system, they have a molecule that says ""me."" What I hope you think is that bacteria can talk to each other, they use chemicals as their words, they have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon that we're just now starting to learn about. So we know that the principles and the rules, if we can figure them out in these sort of primitive organisms, the hope is that they will be applied to other human diseases and human behaviors as well.","There's about a trillion human cells that make each one of us who we are and able to do all the things that we do.

You know, because -- and by the way to I was so grateful to Dean Kamen for pointing out that one of the reasons, that there are cultural reasons that women and minorities don't enter the fields of science and technology -- because for instance, the reason I don't do math is, I was taught to do math and read at the same time.

414,"What I wanted to talk to you about today is two things: one, the rise of a culture of availability; and two, a request. Apologies to Hans Rosling -- he said anything that's not using real stats is a lie -- but the big delta there is how we deal with this from a public standpoint. And if you've ever been in a meeting where you play sort of meeting ""chicken,"" you're sitting there, looking at the person, waiting for them to look away, and then quickly checking the device.

415,"So that is not going to be the path to go. And then sort of through a process of wandering around, I got to the thought that actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars, in a way that is convenient and affordable, you could get to a solution. Not how do you build one car, but how do you scale this so that it can become something that is used by 99 percent of the population? The thought that came to mind is that it needs to be as good as any car that you would have today. So one, it has to be more convenient than a car. How do you do it within the economics that we have today? If you park your car and didn't plug in the heater, when you come back you don't have a car. But the crude oil is replaced with a battery. First he let me go to the prime minister of the country, who told me, if you can find the money you need for this network, 200 million dollars, and if you can find a car company that will build that car in mass volume, in two million cars -- that's what we needed in Israel -- I'll give you country to invest the 200 million into. As we stared scaling it up we looked at what is the problem to come up to the U.S.? By 2015 we would have had at least 250 million new cars even at the pace we're going at right now. The business model in which the money that is actually coming in, to drive the car -- the minutes, the miles if you want, that you are all familiar with -- subsidize the price of the car, just like cellphones. But our cars are actually going to be cheaper than gasoline cars. And those are not 20 percent by 2020. And we need to do it not within 20 years or 50 years, but within this presidential term because if we don't, we will lose our economy, right after we'd lost our morality.","CNN's John Defterios asks how to convert an entire country to electric cars.

416,"The future of life, where the unraveling of our biology -- and bring up the lights a little bit. And yet, I don't really think it is because when it comes down to it, it's this larger trajectory that is really what is going to remain -- what people in the future are going to remember about this period. The reason I'm doing that is because those are going to be the areas that are the most significant to us. So it's not surprising that some people would wonder whether maybe 30 or 40 years from now, we'll look back at this instant in time, and all of the sort of talk about the Human Genome Project, and what all this is going to mean to us -- well, it will really mean precious little. Because when we talk about our genetics and our biology, and modifying and altering and adjusting these things, we're talking about changing ourselves. The first of them is the obvious one, the silicon revolution, which you all are very, very familiar with. And look around you and know that what we really care about is that little bit of difference. A generation or so away there are going to be even more profound things that are going to happen. And if you don't, who are you going to be? But when something is feasible in thousands of laboratories all over the world, which is going to be the case with these technologies, when there are large numbers of people who see them as beneficial, which is already the case, and when they're almost impossible to police, it's not a question of if this is going to happen, it's when and where and how it's going to happen. In the midst of all this amazing technology, and all these things that are occurring, it's really interesting because there is sort of a counter-revolution that is going on: a resurgence of interest in remedies from the past, in nutraceuticals, in all of these sorts of things that some people, in the pharmaceutical industry particularly, like to brand as non-science. And I don't think that's what's going to happen. So to me, it's clear that one of the foundations of that future is going to be the reworking of our biology. And what's extraordinary is that we're not just observing this, we are the architects of this. It's our health, it's our lives, it's our future, it's our children.","When we talk about our genetics and our biology, we're talking about changing ourselves.

The most friction you have is when you first put your hand or your foot on the rock. Don't do it. You have to plan ahead to get to the top. The interesting thing about this climb is it's not that hard. So you've got to focus. The best climbers are the ones that in the most extreme situations can get their bodies into some position where they can rest, regroup, calm themselves, focus, and keep going. One of the things in climbing is, most people sort of take it straight on. Beginning guys, it's like, they thrash, they thrash, they get 15 feet up -- and they can do about 15 pull-ups right -- And then they just flame out. Women are much more in balance because they don't have that idea that they're going to be able to do 100 pull-ups. They think about how to get the weight over their feet because it's sort of natural -- they carry you all day long. And of course there is rule number nine. I came up with rule number nine after I actually didn't plan for a fall, and went about 40 feet and cracked a rib. Once you get to that point where you know it's going to happen, you need to start thinking about how you're going to let go because that is the critical piece of not getting hurt -- how you're going to fall onto the rope, or if you're climbing without a rope, fall to a place where you can actually control the fall.","The most friction you have is when you first put your hand or your foot on the rock.

It's also a project that in a very beautiful way, the development of this has actually paralleled the evolution of life on earth, which is a particularly lovely thing to be saying right here in February 2009 -- which, as one of our previous speakers told us, is the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin.

421,"(Laughter) But this was real romance to me. The product was that airplane. So I had to give up the approach of drawing the fantasy shapes and convert it to technical drawings -- the shape of the wing, the shape of the fuselage and so on -- and build an airplane over these drawings that I knew followed some of the principles of flying. And it had, once it was in the air, some of this romance that I was in love with. Well in 25 years I was mostly putting out pieces of this romance and not getting a lot back in because design on call doesn't always connect you with a circumstance in which you can produce things of this nature. When I was doing those model airplanes, I did everything. And the loose ideas had something to do with what I knew happened with people in the office, at the work place -- people who worked, and used task seating, a great many of them sitting in front of a computer all day long. So I took the approach that the chair should do as much for them as humanly possible or as mechanistically possible so that they didn't have to fuss with it. So that if you sit down on my chair, whether you're five feet tall or six foot six, it always deals with your weight and transfers the amount of force required to recline in a way that you don't have to look for something to adjust.

I worked a long time on figuring out how to move the arms over a much greater arc -- that is up and down -- and make them a lot easier, so that you didn't have to use a button. And the more you can recline, in a way, the better it is. The more the angle between here and here opens up -- and nowadays, with a screen in front of you, you don't want to have your eye drop too far in the recline, so we keep it at more or less the same level -- but you transfer weight off your tailbones. When you recline you take away a lot of that load off your bottom end, and transfer it to your back. But to do that, if you have any amount of recline, it gets to the point where you need a headrest because nearly always, automatically hold your head in a vertical position, see?","Design on call doesn't always connect you with a circumstance in which you can produce things of this nature.

422,"But there is also this part of the country, kind of in the middle region here. So, when we think about parts of the country like Arkansas, you know. And we think people like this probably don't want to vote for people who look like this and are named Barack Obama. Actually we didn't ask them, but when they conducted exit polls in every state, in 37 states, out of the 50, they asked a question, that was pretty direct, about race. So you see big differences in different parts of the country on this question. In Louisiana, about one in five white voters said, ""Yes, one of the big reasons why I voted against Barack Obama is because he was an African-American."" You kind of see the relationship between the redder states of where more people responded and said, ""Yes, Barack Obama's race was a problem for me."" And so we can look at a bunch of different variables. And there are a couple of these that have strong predictive relationships, one of which is education, where you see the states with the fewest years of schooling per adult are in red, and you see this part of the country, the kind of Appalachians region, is less educated. So it's the combination of these two things: it's education and the type of neighbors that you have, which we'll talk about more in a moment. So what we're going to do now is take the white people in the survey and split them between those who have black neighbors -- or, really, some neighbor of another race -- and people who have only white neighbors. But you see Democrats versus Republican, not a big difference based on who your neighbors are. And even some questions about race -- for example affirmative action, which is kind of a political question, a policy question about race, if you will -- not much difference here.

423,"And in that time we prototyped and built, in about three days, a system that would allow anybody with a mobile phone to send in information and reports on what was happening around them. It was a mash-up that used data that we collected from people, and we put it on our map. But then we decided we needed to do something more. We needed to take what we had built and create a platform out of it so that it could be used elsewhere in the world. And so there is a team of developers from all over Africa, who are part of this team now -- from Ghana, from Malawi, from Kenya. And so we build for it in Africa first and then we move to the edges. But that's actually not what I'm here to talk about. We're seeing this in events like Mumbai recently, where it's so much easier to report now than it is to consume it. There is so much information; what do you do? So what we find is that there is this great deal of wasted crisis information because there is just too much information for us to actually do anything with right now. How do we deal with that information that is coming in? On the ground and around the world people are still curious, and trying to figure out what is going on. So we think that there is something interesting we can do here. This is the kind of innovation that is, quite frankly -- it's interesting that it's coming from Africa.

(Laughter) This sound colors our first impression of any room; it can't be helped. Or is it the amplified sound of a synapse firing in the brain of a cockroach? The sound made flicking a wall switch off is of a completely different nature. Children don't like it. Why have we settled so quickly for the sound of its switch? That's the end of that.

But what is new is that the greater function of ideas is going to drive growth even more than ever before. Suppose that there are two diseases: one of them is rare, the other one is common, but if they are not treated they are equally severe. Now think about the following: if China and India were as rich as the United States is today, the market for cancer drugs would be eight times larger than it is now. Now we are not there yet, but it is happening. But in this century China is coming on line. This is China. Now think what this means. We need a greater demand for ideas -- those larger markets I was talking about earlier -- and a greater supply of ideas for the world. 1500 to 1800: maybe a little bit of economic growth, but less in a century than you expect to see in a year today. Now let's imagine that you were an economist in 1929, trying to forecast future growth for the United States, not knowing that the economy was about to go off a cliff, not knowing that we were about to enter the greatest economic disaster certainly in the 20th century. (Laughter) And there is some truth to this, in the sense that we have something of a finite resource, and increased growth is going to push up demand for that.

426,"It's all about change. And so they also account for development of defective processing in a substantial population of children who are more limited, as a consequence, in their language abilities at an older age. You can look down in the brain of an animal that's engaged in a specific skill, and you can witness or document this change on a variety of levels. If we look at the selectivity of responses in the cortex of the monkey, we see that the monkey has actually changed the filter characteristics which represents input from the skin of the fingertips that are engaged. Monkey has like you have. There are 15 or 20 cortical areas that are changed specifically when you learn a simple skill like this. Think about the changes that occur in the brain of a child through the course of acquiring their movement behavior abilities in general. Because in most of the life of the brain this is under control of behavioral context. We now have a large body of literature that demonstrates that the fundamental problem that occurs in the majority of children that have early language impairments, and that are going to struggle to learn to read, is that their language processor is created in a defective form. And the native language for a child with such a brain is degraded. The point is is that you can train the brain out of this. A way to think about this is you can actually re-refine the processing capacity of the machinery by changing it. This is from about 3,000 children. You can see that most of the children on the left side of the distribution are moving into the middle or the right. And you can actually look down on the brain of such an individual and witness a change in the time constants and space constants with which, for example, the brain is representing language again.","It's all about change.

428,"But we're now up to 55 countries in the world, have had this virus emerge, in either birds, or people or both. It's not going to do us very much good in a global pandemic. And we don't have a huge number of people who got infected and never developed disease. So what have people been doing with this money? Most of these people don't actually know what their job will be. Most local facilities would all be competing to try and get their hands on their piece of the federal stockpile of a drug called Tamiflu, which may or may not be helpful -- I'll get into that -- of available vaccines, and any other treatments, and masks, and anything that's been stockpiled. Well then what about all the workers? Can we figure out a way, since we know we won't have enough masks because we don't make them in America anymore, they're all made in China -- do we need N95?

429,"And I promised to come back and give you an update on how that machine worked. So this is it. Its job is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began, up to 600 million times a second. This is the one I work on. On the 10th of September last year we turned the machine on for the first time. And this picture was taken by ATLAS. It's a picture of the first beam particle going all the way around the LHC, colliding with a piece of the LHC deliberately, and showering particles into the detector. In other words, when we saw that picture on September 10th we knew the machine worked, which is a great triumph. Now the engineers amongst you will look at them and say, ""No they don't. They're small wires."" In one of the joints between over 9,000 magnets in LHC, there was a manufacturing defect. We had to take them out, which we did. They're all on their way back underground now. We will switch it on, and we expect to take data in June or July, and continue with our quest to find out what the building blocks of the universe are. I will leave the final word to an English scientist, Humphrey Davy, who, I suspect, when defending his protege's useless experiments -- his protege was Michael Faraday -- said this, ""Nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultimate, that there are no mysteries in nature, that our triumphs are complete, and that there are no new worlds to conquer.""","LHC's job is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began, up to 600 million times a second.

It's all in the streams of information we consume daily, we just have to know how to pull it out. What if we were to look at the distribution of the sizes of attacks? And you can see here on the horizontal axis you've got the number of people killed in an attack or the size of the attack. You take all of the conflict, all of the chaos, all of the noise, and out of that comes this precise mathematical distribution of the way attacks are ordered in this conflict.

431,"But I think it does matter which way we go and what road we take, because when I think about design in the near future, what I think are the most important issues, what's really crucial and vital, is that we need to revitalize the arts and sciences right now, in 2002. (Applause) If we describe the near future as 10, 20, 15 years from now, that means that what we do today is going to be critically important, because in the year 2015, in the year 2020, 2025, the world our society is going to be building on, the basic knowledge and abstract ideas, the discoveries that we came up with today, just as all these wonderful things we're hearing about here at the TED conference that we take for granted in the world right now, were really knowledge and ideas that came up in the 50s, the 60s and the 70s. What do we have to do? But I'm going to let you know that some folks in the outside world, believe it or not, think it's neat when they say, ""Scientists and science is not creative. But when I think about the '60s, what I took away from it was that there was hope for the future. And I had to say, ""Because it represents human creativity; the creativity that allowed us, that we were required to have to conceive and build and launch the space shuttle, which springs from the same source as the imagination and analysis that it took to carve a Bundu statue, or the ingenuity it took to design, choreograph and stage ""Cry."" But sometimes people use this analysis idea, that things are outside of ourselves, to say, this is what we're going to elevate as the true, most important sciences, right? But, we've even had that here on stage, so don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about. How does understanding science and the arts fit into our lives and what's going on and the things we're talking about here at the design conference? The first thing they said was that the circumstances that we find ourselves in today in the sciences and engineering that made us world leaders are very different than the '40s, the '50s, and the '60s and the '70s, when we emerged as world leaders, because we're no longer in competition with fascism, with Soviet-style communism. That doesn't mean that everything has to have one thing that's going to go on, or that we know exactly what's going to be the outcome of it, but that we support the vitality and the intellectual curiosity that goes along [with it]. So we have to really stop and think: What are we trying to do with the sciences and the arts? You know, you would ask patients questions and some people would tell you, ""Don't listen to what the patient said."" We have all kinds of possibilities to use our senses by, and that's what we have to do.

And don't despise the white bread because it really, I think, symbolizes the fact that bread and food have become plentiful and affordable to all.

And this is where I have to query all of you. In fact not many of you know that our bread, of course, was not a European invention. What you see is that we've started in the left-hand corner with traditional agriculture, which was sort of small-scale and low-control. What I want us to do is to keep up the science and even get more science in there but go to a kind of regional scale -- not just in terms of the scale of the fields, but in terms of the entire food network. So we can do that. And the kind of simplistic solutions that we sometimes have, to think that doing everything by hand is going to be the solution, is really not morally justified.

Now, you can see United States, in 1983, had a very low percentage infected, but due to the big population, still a sizable bubble. Now you have understood the graph and now, in the next 60 seconds, we will play the HIV epidemic in the world. In Asia, the first country to be heavily infected was Thailand -- they reached one to two percent. In the last two to three years, we have reached a steady state of HIV epidemic in the world. And if people who are infected are treated, they don't die of AIDS. But the poorer countries in Africa, the low-income countries down here, there the rates fall faster, of the percentage infected, because people still die. So, when we look at the pattern, one thing comes out very clearly: you see the blue bubbles and people say HIV is very high in Africa. It's this terrible simplification that there's one Africa and things go on in one way in Africa. (Laughter) And so it is in Africa -- it's a lot of difference. See the difference within one African country -- it goes from very low level to very high level, and most of the provinces in Kenya is quite modest. Look, the highly infected are four percent of all population and they hold 50 percent of the HIV-infected.

One is in the south and in the west of India, which is already going to be fully expensed by 2015, because in that part of the country, the fertility rate is almost equal to that of a West European country. I believe these six factors -- the rise of the notion of population as human capital, the rise of Indian entrepreneurs, the rise of English as a language of aspiration, technology as something empowering, globalization as a positive factor, and the deepening of democracy -- has contributed to why India is today growing at rates it has never seen before. But now I believe it's reached a point where it has become very important. So I believe primary education is an idea which is arrived but not yet implemented. These four factors I believe -- the ones of primary education, infrastructure, urbanization, and single market -- in my view are ideas in India which have been accepted, but not implemented. Therefore we need to create a new set of labor laws, which are not as onerous as they are today. At the same time give a policy for a lot more people to be in the formal sector, and create the jobs for the millions of people that we need to create jobs for. The first thing is, we're very fortunate that technology is at a point where it is much more advanced than when other countries had the development. And it is important to prove that growth and democracy are not incompatible, that you can have a democracy, that you can have an open society, and you can have growth. When India was growing at about three, 3.5 percent and the population was growing at two percent, its per capita income was doubling every 45 years.","India is going to have a lot of young people with a demographic dividend for the next 30 years.

439,"And the solution I offer is to the biggest culprit in this massive mistreatment of the earth by humankind, and the resulting decline of the biosphere. And by the way he convicted me as a plunderer of the earth. And I then challenged the people of Interface, my company, to lead our company and the entire industrial world to sustainability, which we defined as eventually operating our petroleum-intensive company in such a way as to take from the earth only what can be renewed by the earth, naturally and rapidly -- not another fresh drop of oil -- and to do no harm to the biosphere. But I realized, for that to be true -- for theft of our children's future to be a crime -- there must be a clear, demonstrable alternative to the take-make-waste industrial system that so dominates our civilization, and is the major culprit, stealing our children's future, by digging up the earth and converting it to products that quickly become waste in a landfill or an incinerator -- in short, digging up the earth and converting it to pollution. So we set out at Interface, in 1994, to create an example: to transform the way we made carpet, a petroleum-intensive product for materials as well as energy, and to transform our technologies so they diminished environmental impact, rather than multiplied it. I wanted Interface to rewrite that equation so that it read I equals P times A divided by T. Now, the mathematically-minded will see immediately that T in the numerator increases impact -- a bad thing -- but T in the denominator decreases impact. In the new industrial revolution extractive must be replaced by renewable; linear by cyclical; fossil fuel energy by renewable energy, sunlight; wasteful by waste-free; and abusive by benign; and labor productivity by resource productivity. But the marketplace was down 36 percent. (Laughter) If we can actually do it, it must be possible. Not you. Not I. And when I read it it was one of the most uplifting moments of my life.

442,"Two years ago here at TED I reported that we had discovered at Saturn, with the Cassini Spacecraft, an anomalously warm and geologically active region at the southern tip of the small Saturnine moon Enceladus, seen here. This region seen here for the first time in the Cassini image taken in 2005. And seen just recently in late 2008, here is that region again, now half in darkness because the southern hemisphere is experiencing the onset of August and eventually winter. And I also reported that we'd made this mind-blowing discovery -- this once-in-a-lifetime discovery of towering jets erupting from those fractures at the south pole, consisting of tiny water ice crystals accompanied by water vapor and simple organic compounds like carbon dioxide and methane. And at that time two years ago I mentioned that we were speculating that these jets might in fact be geysers, and erupting from pockets or chambers of liquid water underneath the surface, but we weren't really sure. However, the implications of those results -- of a possible environment within this moon that could support prebiotic chemistry, and perhaps life itself -- were so exciting that, in the intervening two years, we have focused more on Enceladus. We've flown the Cassini Spacecraft by this moon now several times, flying closer and deeper into these jets, into the denser regions of these jets, so that now we have come away with some very precise compositional measurements. And we have found that the organic compounds coming from this moon are in fact more complex than we previously reported. While they're not amino acids, we're now finding things like propane and benzene, hydrogen cyanide, and formaldehyde. So we are very encouraged by these results. And we are much more confident now than we were two years ago that we might indeed have on this moon, under the south pole, an environment or a zone that is hospitable to living organisms. And that will have to await the arrival, back at Enceladus, of the spacecrafts, hopefully some time in the near future, specifically equipped to address that particular question. But in the meantime I invite you to imagine the day when we might journey to the Saturnine system, and visit the Enceladus interplanetary geyser park, just because we can. Thank you.

447,"Just think for a moment. All these things, they come back to plants. And they are also under threat because they are sharing a planet with people like us. And plants sometimes find it rather difficult to move because there might be cities and other things in the way. So if all human life depends on plants, doesn't it make sense that perhaps we should try to save them? And the way that you save plants is by storing seeds. So if you're going to build a seed bank, you have to decide what you're going to store in it. And we decided that what we want to store first of all, are the species that are most under threat. They search for them. You do some high-tech things here and there, some low-tech things here and there. And the main thing is that you have to dry them very carefully, at low temperature. And these seeds will be able to germinate, we believe, with many of the species, in thousands of years, and certainly in hundreds of years. That means that we know the right combination of heat and cold and the cycles that you have to get to make the seed germinate. And then we grow these things, and we tell people, back in the countries where these seeds have come from, ""Look, actually we're not just storing this to get the seeds later, but we can give you this information about how to germinate these difficult plants."" So in habitats that have already been damaged, like the tall grass prairie here in the USA, or in mined land in various countries, restoration is already happening because of these species -- and because of this collection.","Plants are under threat because they are sharing a planet with people like us.

450,"When we walked through the savanna a thousand years ago we made linear predictions where that animal would be, and that worked fine. But the pace of exponential growth is really what describes information technologies. Information technology progresses through a series of S-curves where each one is a different paradigm. And Moore's Law was not the first paradigm to bring exponential growth to computing. And that was the end of the shrinking of vacuum tubes, but it was not the end of the exponential growth of computing. I was a little nervous because maybe the data wouldn't be right, but I've done this now for 30 years, and it has stayed on this exponential progression. We've had 18 percent growth in constant dollars in every form of information technology for the last half-century, despite the fact that you can get twice as much of it each year. And this has been a smooth progression since the beginning of the genome project. Because if you double one percent seven more times, which is exactly what happened, you get 100 percent.

453,"But I'm moving past Malthus, because I think that we just might be about 150 years from a kind of new enlightenment. This is the U.N.'s population data, you may have seen, for the world. And after that, most likely it's going to begin to decline. One: fewer people on a fixed amount of land make investing in property a bad bet. Number two: a declining population means scarce labor. As wages increase that also lifts the burden on the poor and the working class. But look what happened in Europe after the plague: rising wages, land reform, technological innovation, birth of the middle class; and after that, forward-looking social movements like the Renaissance, and later the Enlightenment. But I think we're in for another change, about two generations after the top of that curve, once the effects of a declining population start to settle in. At that point, we'll start romanticizing the future again, instead of the nasty, brutish past. So why does this matter? Why talk about social-economic movements that may be more than a century away? When land owners start to lose money, and labor demands more pay, there are some powerful interests that are going to fear for the future. If we have a positive view about the future then we may be able to accelerate through that turn, instead of careening off a cliff. And instead, they'll be planning for the future and starting to build the 22nd Century Enlightenment. (Applause)","A declining population means scarce labor.

454,"This is a world-changing invention. And one of the main causes of all these fires is electricity. What if we could prevent electrical fires before they start? Well, a couple of friends and I figured out how to do this. So what about circuit breakers? This is 130-year-old technology, and this is a problem, because over 80 percent of all home electrical fires start below the safety threshold of circuit breakers. So we considered all of this. And we realized that electrical appliances must be able to communicate directly with the power receptacle itself. And the power outlet needs to be smart enough to do it. We put a 10-cent digital transponder, a data tag, in the appliance plug. Now, every home electrical system becomes an intelligent network. An intelligent receptacle prevents injuries because the power is always off, until an intelligent plug is detected. Now, besides saving lives, perhaps the greatest benefit of intelligent power is in its energy savings. This invention will reduce global energy consumption by allowing remote control and automation of every outlet in every home and business. And I'd like to thank Chris for this opportunity to unveil our technology with you, and soon the world.","Over 80 percent of all home electrical fires start below the safety threshold of circuit breakers.

456,"We are wired to pursue happiness, not only to enjoy it, but to want more and more of it. It isn't just that. Now the good news here is that if you take surveys from around the world, we see that about three quarters of people will say they are at least pretty happy. We also find that people are more averse to losing than they are happy to gain. We have a system that is really ancient, and really there for physical danger. Absent from this list, and absent from any discussions of happiness, are happiness in another's happiness. We are very sensitive to the negative, but it is in part offset by the fact that we have a positivity. There was once a statement made by a psychologist that said that 80 percent of the pursuit of happiness is really just about the genes, and it's as difficult to become happier as it is to become taller. There is a decent contribution to happiness from the genes -- about 50 percent -- but there is still that 50 percent that is unaccounted for. It turned out that it wasn't, that it really is a system of motivation, a system of wanting. And one of them, of course, is biophilia -- that we have a response to the natural world that's very profound. The other thing is, that a piece of evidence is, is if you look at computerized text analysis of people who commit suicide, what you find there, and it's quite interesting, is use of the first person singular -- ""I,"" ""me,"" ""my,"" not ""we"" and ""us"" -- and the letters are less hopeless than they are really alone. And that's clearly the way for us to create many more niches of status so that people don't have to be lower on the status hierarchy as they are in the animal world. So one of the things is that it really takes over. ""First, say to yourself what you would be.","We are wired to pursue happiness, not only to enjoy it, but to want more and more of it.

But then I stopped, because I figured I was this hot-shot guy and I shouldn't have to work at ideas, they should just come like magic. Reaching success, I always focused on clients and projects, and ignored the money. But then I got into stuff that I didn't love, like management. I am the world's worst manager, but I figured I should be doing it, because I was, after all, the president of the company.

459,"I mean, what is a biosphere? Back then, yes, I guess we all know now that it is essentially the sphere of life around the Earth, right? And so we decided that what it really is is that it is entirely materially closed -- that is, nothing goes in or out at all, no material -- and energetically open, which is essentially what planet Earth is. We also wanted to know so we can understand more about the Earth that we all live in. So, on the top, we had these beautiful rainforests and an ocean, and underneath we had all this technosphere, we called it, which is where all the pumps and the valves and the water tanks and the air handlers, and all of that. And the doctor was, in fact, checking us to make sure we were, in fact, fine. And it was time for us to put oxygen in. So at the end of the two years when we came out, we were elated, because, in fact, although you might say we had discovered something that was quite ""uhh,"" when your oxygen is going down, stopped working, essentially, in your life support system, that's a very bad failure. And I slowly lost track of where I was in this big biosphere, in this big biosphere that we all live in. In Biosphere 2 I totally understood that I had a huge impact on my biosphere, everyday, and it had an impact on me, very viscerally, very literally. And one of the things we did was try to figure out: how small can you make these biospheres, and what can you do with them? But this is also what I saw. Well, of course you have to draw the boundary around the whole of the Earth. And over time, essentially what have I been doing?

460,"I want to talk about the transformed media landscape, and what it means for anybody who has a message that they want to get out to anywhere in the world. Because now that media is increasingly social, innovation can happen anywhere that people can take for granted the idea that we're all in this together. If you want to address a group, you get the same message and you give it to everybody in the group, whether you're doing that with a broadcasting tower or a printing press. That was the media landscape as we had it in the twentieth century. The Internet is the first medium in history that has native support for groups and conversation at the same time. The second big change is that, as all media gets digitized, the Internet also becomes the mode of carriage for all other media, meaning that phone calls migrate to the Internet, magazines migrate to the Internet, movies migrate to the Internet. And the earthquake was reported as it was happening. And so as the quake was happening the news was reported. And the Chinese then, in one of their periods of media openness, decided that they were going to let it go, that they were going to let this citizen reporting fly. And it was produced at such an incredible abundance that there was no way to filter it as it appeared. And so now the Chinese government, who for a dozen years, has quite successfully filtered the web, is now in the position of having to decide whether to allow or shut down entire services, because the transformation to amateur media is so enormous that they can't deal with it any other way. The classic media problem, from the 20th century is, how does an organization have a message that they want to get out to a group of people distributed at the edges of a network. But you can get used to it after a while, as people do. In a world where media is global, social, ubiquitous and cheap, in a world of media where the former audience are now increasingly full participants, in that world, media is less and less often about crafting a single message to be consumed by individuals. And the choice we face, I mean anybody who has a message they want to have heard anywhere in the world, isn't whether or not that is the media environment we want to operate in.","I want to talk about the transformed media landscape, and what it means for anybody who has a message that they want to get out to anywhere in the world.

461,"What I didn't know though, was most of those people, standing there with me, were Moonies. (Laughter) And within a week I had come to believe that the second coming of Christ had occurred, that it was Sun Myung Moon, and that I had been specially chosen and prepared by God to be his disciple. I started going out on cases. And we would come in and talk to them, usually for about a week. And so after this happened, I decided it was a good time to turn my back on this work. And that was, ""How did this happen to me?"" And in fact, what did happen to my brain?

462,"So in order to give you some kind of a perspective of where we are right now with surgical robots, and where we're going to be going in the future, I want to give you a little bit of perspective of how we got to this point, how we even came to believe that surgery was OK, that this was something that was possible to do, that this kind of cutting and reforming was OK. Because we were in the age before anesthesia, the agony of the patient is really as much of the public spectacle as the surgery itself. But there was a pretty big problem with this. Some of the tools for this had been around for a hundred years, but it had only been used as a diagnostic technique until the 1980s, when there was changes in camera technologies and things like that, that allowed this to be done for real operations. So what you see -- this is now the first surgical image -- as we're coming down the tube, this is a new entry into the body. So what you need to do, to take the capability of your hand, and put it on the other side of that small incision, is you need to put a wrist on that instrument. And now, in contrast to the laparoscopy, you can precisely place the needle in your instruments, and you can pass it all the way through and follow it in a trajectory. And you need to put some new incisions in there. But what this lets you do is gives you that all-important traction, and counter-traction, so that you can dissect, so that you can sew, so that you can do all the things that you need to do, all the surgical tasks. This is all they're going to see. As we take these capabilities, and we get to go to the next places, we get to decide what our new surgeries are going to be. This is a cancer surgery. We can inject these dyes into the bloodstream, so that when we do a new vessel and we bypass a blockage on the heart, we can see if we actually made the connection, before we close that patient back up again -- something that we haven't been able to do without radiation before. So this is all very prototypey at this point. So, with the combination of these technologies we can reach it all, and we can see it all.","The first surgical image was taken in the 1980s.

There were enormous differences between kids who resisted and kids who yielded, in many ways. So what is time perspective? That's what I'm going to talk about today. And the problem is that they can become biased, because you learn to over-use some of them and under-use the others. For some people it's only about what is in the immediate situation, what other people are doing and what you're feeling. And those people, when they make their decisions in that format -- we're going to call them ""present-oriented,"" because their focus is what is now. For others it's not the past, it's not the present, it's only about the future. Developing the mental flexibility to shift time perspectives fluidly depending on the demands of the situation, that's what you've got to learn to do. What do futures sacrifice for success?

464,"So that is what you get when you face reality. And that needs to be recognized, first of all, that peacekeeping works. If you don't get the policy reform and the aid, you don't get the economic recovery, which is the true exit strategy for the peacekeepers. It would be ideal to have a standard set of norms where, when we got to a post-conflict situation, there was an expectation of these mutual commitments from the three parties. And I want to suggest that in the typical post-conflict situation three things are critical. What is a distinctive approach to generating jobs in post-conflict situations? And why are jobs so important? And why are they upset? There's one sector which isn't exposed to international trade, and which can generate a lot of jobs, and which is, in any case, a sensible sector to expand, post-conflict, and that is the construction sector. If we do that, we not only get the jobs, we get the improvements in public infrastructure, the restoration of public infrastructure. And because the government would be funding it, it would be co-branding these services. The typical post-conflict government is so short of money that it needs our money just to be on a life-support system. And if all we do is put money in and close our eyes it's not just that the money is wasted -- that's the least of the problems -- it's that the money is captured. That after 10 years, the focus on the construction sector would have produced both jobs and, hence, security -- because young people would have jobs -- and it would have reconstructed the infrastructure. The emphasis on clean government would have gradually squeezed out the political crooks, because there wouldn't be any money in taking part in the politics.","Peacekeeping works, but if you don't get policy reform and aid, you donâ€™t get the economic recovery.

And I'm here to say that I think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid ... that the correct summit -- that all of our students, every high school graduate should know -- should be statistics: probability and statistics. But I'm here to say, as a professor of mathematics, that very few people actually use calculus in a conscious, meaningful way, in their day-to-day lives. Right? It's risk. It's reward. (Laughter) (Applause) Not only -- thank you -- not only that ... but if it's taught properly, it can be a lot of fun. I mean, probability and statistics, it's the mathematics of games and gambling. It's analyzing trends. It's predicting the future. And it's time for our mathematics curriculum to change from analog to digital, from the more classical, continuous mathematics, to the more modern, discrete mathematics -- the mathematics of uncertainty, of randomness, of data -- that being probability and statistics. In summary, instead of our students learning about the techniques of calculus, I think it would be far more significant if all of them knew what two standard deviations from the mean means. And I mean it.","President Obama has invited me to be the next Czar of Mathematics. I have a suggestion for him that would vastly improve the mathematics education in this country.

468,"This is the exact moment that I started creating something called Tinkering School. Tinkering School is a place where kids can pick up sticks and hammers and other dangerous objects, and be trusted. Trusted not to hurt themselves, and trusted not to hurt others. When the kids arrive they're confronted with lots of stuff: wood and nails and rope and wheels, and lots of tools, real tools. It's a six-day immersive experience for the kids. Our goal is to ensure that they leave with a better sense of how to make things than when they arrived, and the deep internal realization that you can figure things out by fooling around. Nothing ever turns out as planned ... ever. (Laughter) And the kids soon learn that all projects go awry -- (Laughter) and become at ease with the idea that every step in a project is a step closer to sweet success, or gleeful calamity. And sometimes we make real plans. And sometimes we just start building. Building is at the heart of the experience: hands on, deeply immersed and fully committed to the problem at hand. Robin and I, acting as collaborators, keep the landscape of the projects tilted towards completion. Problems become puzzles and obstacles disappear. When faced with particularly difficult setbacks or complexities, a really interesting behavior emerges: decoration.

And I think that is indeed what architecture is. There it is: the things that I really believe are of important architecture. And I think that is what architecture is, it's radical. And of course, we are all about the struggle of emotions. They connect themselves into various sources, into a kind of complex vector matrix that isn't really frontal but is really embedded in the lives, and in the history of a city, and of a people. I think that's part of what the complexity of architecture is. So the rawness, I think, in space, the fact that sustainability can actually, in the future translate into a raw space, a space that isn't decorated, a space that is not mannered in any source, but a space that might be cool in terms of its temperature, might be refractive to our desires. The memorable, I think, is really our world, what we think the world is. It should not play it safe, because if it plays it safe it's not moving us in a direction that we want to be.

So that's the part of the brain that is activated when you give a word to something. The third part that I'd like to talk about is the limbic system. So the combination of these processing centers help us make meaning in very different ways. So what can we learn about this? The brain processes this in parallel, the figments of information asking a whole bunch of questions to create a unified mental model. So, for example, when you look at this image a good graphic invites the eye to dart around, to selectively create a visual logic. So the point of this is what? We make meaning by seeing, by an act of visual interrogation. Secondly make those images interactive so that we engage much more fully. So a team can actually look at all the key components that heat the structure and make choices and then see the end result that is visualized on this screen. The first again, is making ideas clear by visualizing them. And I believe that these three principles can be applied to solving some of the very tough problems that we face in the world today.","The Big Viz is a collection of 650 sketches that were made by two visual artists.

The communist Khmer Rouge enters Phnom Penh to liberate their people from the encroaching conflict in Vietnam, and American bombing campaigns. And here is a picture of the Khmer Rouge. And we know money is the root of all evil, but it didn't actually stop evil from happening in Cambodia, in fact. And in fact they were forced to work the fields. And it was at that time that my mother got word from the commune chief that the Vietnamese were actually asking for their citizens to go back to Vietnam. And she decided, despite the advice of her neighbors, that she would take the chance and claim to be Vietnamese so that we could have a chance to survive, because at this point they're forcing everybody to work. So the Khmer Rouge took us from a place called Pursat to Kaoh Tiev, which is across from the border from Vietnam. And my mother's Vietnamese was so bad that to make our story more credible, she'd given all the boys and girls new Vietnamese names. And this is a picture of Hong Ngu, Vietnam today.

473,"And I was pulling a molecule out of this bag. And I was thinking that your body hated it, at the time, because we are very immune to this. Now, I was thinking about that and I said, you know, we've got this immune response to this ridiculous molecule that we don't make, and we see it a lot in other animals and stuff. It was kind of like the same thing that happens when you, like when you're getting stopped for a traffic ticket in L.A., and the cop drops a bag of marijuana in the back of your car, and then charges you for possession of marijuana. (Laughter) So you can take a bacteria that really doesn't make these things at all, and if you could clamp these on it really well you have it taken off the street. And for certain bacteria we don't have really efficient ways to do that anymore. Our antibiotics are running out. So probably it doesn't matter 50 years from now -- streptococcus and stuff like that will be rampant -- because we won't be here. But if we are -- (Laughter) we're going to need something to do with the bacteria. So I started working with this thing, with a bunch of collaborators.

475,"With such a big space, the problem is obviously that there is a discrepancy between what your body can embrace, and what the space, in that sense, is. How do we know that being in a space makes a difference? And it's on the other side also, I think, quite beautiful, as it somehow shows the turbulence in these kind of downtown areas, in these different places of the world. The ""Green river,"" as a kind of activist idea, not a part of an exhibition, it was really about showing people, in this city, as they walk by, that space has dimensions. It makes a difference whether you say, ""I'm a part of this city. This whole idea of a city not being a picture is, I think, something that art, in a sense, always was working with. So these are different experiments with that. This summer, in New York: there is one thing about falling water which is very much about the time it takes for water to fall. It doesn't really tell you what you're looking at. If you have a waterfall in there, right out there at the horizon; you look at the waterfall and you go, ""Oh, the water is falling really slowly."" Adding a measurement to that is interesting: the falling water suddenly gives you a sense of, ""Oh, Brooklyn is exactly this much -- the distance between Brooklyn and Manhattan, in this case the lower East River is this big."" And why would we want to do that? Because I think it makes a difference whether you have a body that feels a part of a space, rather than having a body which is just in front of a picture. So if I have a sense of the space, if I feel that the space is tangible, if I feel there is time, if there is a dimension I could call time, I also feel that I can change the space.

476,"And the way we do this is we basically place this through the soft tissue, and kind of punch it into the hard bone, into the tuchus -- that's a technical term -- and aspirate about 10 mls of bone marrow out, each time, with a syringe.

So I'm thinking, you know, this procedure hasn't changed in about 40 years. This is it. And the Marrow Miner, the way it works is shown here. And we have a flexible, powered catheter with a special wire loop tip that stays inside the crunchy part of the marrow and follows the contours of the hip, as it moves around. And, so, very quickly, Bob can just get one puncture, local anesthesia, and do this harvest as an outpatient. And we found, to our surprise, that we not only got bone marrow out, but we got 10 times the stem cell activity in the marrow from the Marrow Miner, compared to the normal device. This device was just FDA approved in the last year. And we got, again, about three to six times more stem cells than the standard approach done on the same patient.

Adult stem cells are throughout our body, including the blood-forming stem cells in our bone marrow, which we've been using as a form of stem-cell therapy for over 40 years.

The pattern is that those people, every one of them I looked at, who was a murderer, and was a serial killer, had damage to their orbital cortex, which is right above the eyes, the orbits, and also the interior part of the temporal lobe.

478,"Now what is so interesting and to some, the extent, what's a bit infamous about ""The Origin of Species,"" is that there is only one line in it about human evolution. So what did he make of all this? What's significant to the story of human skin pigmentation is just how much of the Northern Hemisphere is in these cool gray zones. And what Darwin could not appreciate, or didn't perhaps want to appreciate at the time, is that there was a fundamental relationship between the intensity of ultraviolet radiation and skin pigmentation. And that skin pigmentation itself was a product of evolution. So, it's wonderful. So if we're somewhere in the Northern Hemisphere, look at what's happening to the ultraviolet radiation. This had tremendous consequences for the evolution of human skin pigmentation. What they haven't been so good about instructing people is the problem of darkly pigmented people living in high latitude areas, or working inside all the time. So we have, in skin pigmentation, one of these wonderful products of evolution that still has consequences for us today. We live in a world where we have lightly and darkly pigmented people living next to one another, but often brought into proximity initially as a result of very invidious social interactions. But we need to think about how he compares, in terms of his pigmentation, to other people on Earth.

479,"This is Birhan, who was the Ethiopian girl who launched Live Aid in the 1980s, 15 minutes away from death when she was rescued, and that picture of her being rescued is one that went round the world. What they have in common is what we see unlocks what we cannot see. What these pictures demonstrate is that there is a moral sense across all religions, across all faiths, across all continents -- a moral sense that not only do we share the pain of others, and believe in something bigger than ourselves but we have a duty to act when we see things that are wrong that need righted, see injuries that need to be corrected, see problems that need to be rectified. We now have the capacity to find common ground with people who we will never meet, but who we will meet through the Internet and through all the modern means of communication; that we now have the capacity to organize and take collective action together to deal with the problem or an injustice that we want to deal with; and I believe that this makes this a unique age in human history, and it is the start of what I would call the creation of a truly global society. She was so appalled by what was happening in Austria as a result of the First World War and what was happening to children who were part of the defeated families of Austria, that in Britain she wanted to take action, but she had to go house to house, leaflet to leaflet, to get people to attend a rally in the Royal Albert Hall that eventually gave birth to Save the Children, an international organization that is now fully recognized as one of the great institutions in our land and in the world. It cannot be run by elites; itâ€™s got to be run by listening to the public opinions of peoples who are blogging, who are communicating with each other around the world. I was with Nelson Mandela a year ago, when he was in London. So the great project of our generation, it seems to me, is to build for the first time, out of a global ethic and our global ability to communicate and organize together, a truly global society, built on that ethic but with institutions that can serve that global society and make for a different future. We have now, and are the first generation with, the power to do this. Is it not absolutely scandalous that we have a situation where we know that there is a climate change problem, where we know also that that will mean we have to give more resources to the poorest countries to deal with that, when we want to create a global carbon market, but there is no global institution that people have been able to agree upon to deal with this problem? (Applause) One of the reasons why an institution is not in itself enough is that we have got to persuade people around the world to change their behavior as well, so you need that global ethic of fairness and responsibility across the generations. So another challenge for our generation is to create global institutions that reflect our ideas of fairness and responsibility, not the ideas that were the basis of the last stage of financial development over these recent years. We do not have the basis of a proper partnership for the future, and yet, out of peopleâ€™s desire for a global ethic and a global society that can be done. When you looked in her eyes, any girl at the age of eleven is looking forward to the future, but there was an unreachable sadness in that girlâ€™s eyes and if I could have translated that to the rest of the world for that moment, I believe that all the work that it had done for the global HIV/AIDS fund would be rewarded by people being prepared to make donations. That global ethic can infuse the fairness and responsibility that is necessary for these institutions to work, but we should not lose the chance in this generation, in this decade in particular, with President Obama in America, with other people working with us around the world, to create global institutions for the environment, and for finance, and for security and for development, that make sense of our responsibility to other peoples, our desire to bind the world together, and our need to tackle problems that everybody knows exist.","Birhan was the Ethiopian girl who launched Live Aid in the 1980s.

480,"I'm mentioning all this -- I'm mentioning all this because I think this is not merely a personal problem; you may think I'm wrong in this, but I think we live in an age when our lives are regularly punctuated by career crises, by moments when what we thought we knew -- about our lives, about our careers -- comes into contact with a threatening sort of reality. I want to look now, if I may, at some of the reasons why we might be feeling anxiety about our careers. You can make it! Everybody, all politicians on Left and Right, agree that meritocracy is a great thing, and we should all be trying to make our societies really, really meritocratic. I think there is. The idea that we will make a society where literally everybody is graded, the good at the top, bad at the bottom, exactly done as it should be, is impossible. (Laughter) (Applause) In a way, if you like, at one end of the spectrum of sympathy, you've got the tabloid newspaper. And I think that is the message of tragedy to us, and why it's so very, very important, I think. We are the first society to be living in a world where we don't worship anything other than ourselves. And one of the interesting things about success is that we think we know what it means. You can't have it all. And the thing about a successful life is that a lot of the time, our ideas of what it would mean to live successfully are not our own. So what I want to argue for is not that we should give up on our ideas of success, but we should make sure that they are our own. Because it's bad enough not getting what you want, but it's even worse to have an idea of what it is you want, and find out, at the end of the journey, that it isn't, in fact, what you wanted all along. But how do you reconcile this idea of it being bad to think of someone as a ""loser,"" with the idea that a lot of people like, of seizing control of your life, and that a society that encourages that, perhaps has to have some winners and losers?","I think we live in an age when our lives are regularly punctuated by career crises.

So, from both directions, there is kind of, I think, a lack of understanding about what it could mean to be an artist who uses the materials of his own day, or her own day, which I think artists are obliged to do, is to really explore the expressive potential of the new tools that we have. And that's how I do it. So. So what we're really seeing here is a phenomenon called phonaesthesia, which is a kind of synesthesia that all of you have. And as you do, you see the shadows of your own speech. So.

482,"And what they're planning to do is to enlighten us on almost every aspect of Darwin and his life, and how he changed our thinking. It's the question of, why are we so different from the chimpanzees? (Laughter) If they haven't got a paradigm they can't ask the question. That's why you don't hear them talking about it. I mean, why don't we talk about, well, there's chromosomes, and there's genes. I'd like to talk about just a handful of what have been called the hallmarks of mankind, the things that made us different from everybody else, and all our relatives. But you can say this: all the apes and all the monkeys are capable of walking on two legs, if they want to, for a short time. There is only one circumstance in which they always, all of them, walk on two legs, and that is when they are wading through water. Well they do know, that if you look at other aquatic mammals, the fat that in most land mammals is deposited inside the body wall, around the kidneys and the intestines and so on, has started to migrate to the outside, and spread out in a layer inside the skin. And the ironic thing about it is that they are not staving off the aquatic theory to protect a theory of their own, which they've all agreed on, and they love. Of course they don't believe it, but they like it."" And they can't all be wrong, can they?""

What made me do this work? What made me do it?

485,"I want to argue that there is a general abstract insight that we can make practical, which is that, if we can give more choices to people, and more choices to leaders -- who, in many countries, are also people. But if we can find ways to give more choices to both, that will give us a set of rules for changing rules that get us out of traps. And he says that if you want to see the damaging effects of rules, the ways that rules can keep people in the dark, look at the pictures from NASA of the earth at night. If you go back to the map at night, you can get a clue to the process that lead to the dramatic change in rules in China. If you try to change the rules in a village, you could do that, but a village would be too small to get the kinds of benefits you can get if you have millions of people all working under good rules. If you try to change the rules in the nation, you can't give some people a chance to hold back, see how things turn out, and let others zoom ahead and try the new rules. We start with a charter that specifies all the rules required to attract the people who we'll need to build the city. This model is all about choices, both for leaders and for the people who will live in these new places. They want to get out. Now, if we generalize this and think about not just one or two charter cites, but dozens -- cities that will help create places for the many hundreds of millions, perhaps billions of people who will move to cities in the coming century -- is there enough land for them? Well, throughout the world, if we look at the lights at night, the one thing that's misleading is that, visually, it looks like most of the world is already built out. So if we wanted to build cities for another billion people, they would be dots like this. So what will it take to get started building the first charter cities, scaling this so we build many more? The reason we can be so well off, even though there is so many people on earth, is because of the power of ideas. If we can keep innovating on our space of rules, and particularly innovate in the sense of coming up with rules for changing rules, so we don't get stuck with bad rules, then we can keep moving progress forward and truly make the world a better place, so that people like Nelson and his friends don't have to study any longer under the streetlights.","If you want to see the damaging effects of rules, look at the pictures from NASA of the earth at night.

486,"This is what I would tell you to remember if you ever forget this again. And I could see why he thought, you know -- it was so beautifully done.

That's not how it's supposed to work, right? These contingent motivators -- if you do this, then you get that -- work in some circumstances. But for a lot of tasks, they actually either don't work or, often, they do harm. If you look at the science, there is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does.

How they do it, when they do it, where they do it, is totally up to them. Do it because you like to do it. So, if we repair this mismatch between science and business, if we bring our motivation, notions of motivation into the 21st century, if we get past this lazy, dangerous, ideology of carrots and sticks, we can strengthen our businesses, we can solve a lot of those candle problems, and maybe, maybe -- we can change the world.","A little over 20 years ago, I regret, something that I'm not particularly proud of.

489,"The thought that you wouldn't want to transfer electric power wirelessly, no one ever thought of that. But the one thing that did come out of electricity is that we love this stuff so much. And for those of us that have an environmental element to us, there is something like 40 billion disposable batteries built every year for power that, generally speaking, is used within a few inches or a few feet of where there is very inexpensive power. So fortunately, one of the other definitions of ""suck"" that was in there, it does create a vacuum. And those two coils of wire are really, really close to each other, and actually do transfer power magnetically and wirelessly, only over a very short distance. What Dr. Soljacic figured out how to do was separate the coils in a transformer to a greater distance than the size of those transformers using this technology, which is not dissimilar from the way an opera singer shatters a glass on the other side of the room. And if you can bring another device close enough to the source, that will only work at exactly that frequency, you can actually get them to do what's called strongly couple, and transfer magnetic energy between them. And then what you do is, you start out with electricity, turn it into magnetic field, take that magnetic field, turn it back into electricity, and then you can use it.

492,"Now, imagine each one of these varieties as being distinct from another about the same way as a poodle from a Great Dane. So if I were to going to show you all the beans in the world, and I had a slide like this, and I switched it every second, it would take up my entire TED talk, and I wouldn't have to say anything. But the interesting thing is that this diversity -- and the tragic thing is -- that this diversity is being lost. So, I want to tell you that the piece of the good news is that the Fowler apple is still out there. And the Fowler apple is described in here -- I hope this doesn't surprise you -- as, ""a beautiful fruit."" (Laughter) I don't know if we named the apple or if the apple named us, but ... but, to be honest, the description goes on and it says that it ""doesn't rank high in quality, however."" The other thing is that maybe that Fowler apple or maybe a variety of wheat that's not economical right now has disease or pest resistance or some quality that we're going to need for climate change that the others don't. I want to show you two slides, but first, I want to tell you that we've been working at the Global Crop Diversity Trust with a number of scientists -- particularly at Stanford and University of Washington -- to ask the question: What's going to happen to agriculture in an era of climate change and what kind of traits and characteristics do we need in our agricultural crops to be able to adapt to this? In short, the answer is that in the future, in many countries, the coldest growing seasons are going to be hotter than anything those crops have seen in the past. By 2030, if the maize, or corn, varieties, which is the dominant crop -- 50 percent of the nutrition in Southern Africa are still in the field -- in 2030, we'll have a 30 percent decrease in production of maize because of the climate change already in 2030. We have collected and conserved a great deal of biological diversity, agricultural diversity, mostly in the form of seed, and we put it in seed banks, which is a fancy way of saying a freezer. So, a number of us got together and decided that, you know, enough is enough and we need to do something about that and we need to have a facility that can really offer protection for our biological diversity of -- maybe not the most charismatic diversity. There are now a couple of security doors, so you won't see it quite like this. I can't look you in the eyes and tell you that I have a solution for climate change, for the water crisis. I can't look you in the eyes and tell you that I have a simple solution for that, but I can look you in the eyes and tell you that we can't solve any of those problems if we don't have crop diversity.","The Fowler apple is described in here -- I hope this doesn't surprise you -- as, ""a beautiful fruit"" The other thing is that maybe that Fowler apple or maybe a variety of wheat that's not economical right now has disease or pest resistance.

493,"But it looks like -- I'm guessing -- that it'll be about 60 percent of the room because that's roughly the fraction of developed world population that have some sort of vision correction. But in fact, I would argue that we've just done an experiment here and now, which shows us that the global need for corrective eyewear is around half of any population. And the problem of poor vision, is actually not just a health problem, it's also an educational problem, and it's an economic problem, and it's a quality of life problem. The problem is, there aren't enough eye care professionals in the world to use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear that we have in the developed world. So this little slide here shows you an optometrist and the little blue person represents about 10,000 people and that's the ratio in the U.K. In fact, there are some countries in sub-Saharan Africa where there's one optometrist for eight million of the population.

494,"What I'm going to try and do is to give some pointers to what I think is the landscape on the other side of the crisis, what things we should be looking out for and how we can actually use the crisis. And I want to talk about how we ensure that this crisis, which is by no means small, really is used to the full. I've got a Ph.D. in Telecoms, as you can see. But what I want to talk about begins when I was at this city, this university, as a student. We've got to do whatever we can to help them, but we've also got to ask, I think, a more profound question of whether we use this crisis to jump forward to a different kind of economy that's more suited to human needs, to a better balance of economy and society. And I think you can see around us now, some of the green shoots of a very different kind of economy and capitalism which could grow. And I'm a very small part of a very large movement, which for some people is about survival, but is also about values, about a different kind of economy, which isn't so much about consumption and credit, but about things which matter to us. And everywhere, as people think about the unprecedented sums which are being spent of our money and our children's money, now, in the depth of this crisis, they're asking: Surely, we should be using this with a longer-term vision to accelerate the shift to a green economy, to prepare for aging, to deal with some of the inequalities which scar countries like this and the United States rather than just giving the money to the incumbents? It's not that our scientists are necessarily much smarter than they were a hundred years ago, maybe they are, but they have a hell of a lot more backing than they ever did. He believed if you see a problem, you shouldn't tell someone to act, you should act on it yourself, and he lived long enough and saw enough of his ideas first scorned and then succeed that he said you should always take no as a question and not as an answer. And what people are beginning to ask is: Surely, just as we invest in R and D, two, three, four percent, of our GDP, of our economy, what if we put, let's say, one percent of public spending into social innovation, into elder care, new kinds of education, new ways of helping the disabled? I think what this is all about, this whole movement which is growing from the margins, remains quite small. It will become more involved in social investment, and social care and in industries where the value comes from what you do with others, not just from what you sell to them, and from relationships as well as from consumption. But I've been struck with a parallel in how people often talk about capitalism today and how they talked about the monarchy 200 years ago, just after the French Revolution and the restoration of the monarchy in France. But this is one of those very rare moments when we have to choose whether we're just pedaling furiously to get back to where we were a year or two ago, and a very narrow idea of what the economy is for, or whether this is a moment to jump ahead, to reboot and to do some of the things we probably should have been doing anyway.","What I'm going to try and do is to give some pointers to what I think is the landscape on the other side of the crisis.

495,"Through my work, I've been trying to find ways to harness and unveil this. And so this basically led me to a subject called cymatics. Now, cymatics is the process of visualizing sound by basically vibrating a medium such as sand or water, as you can see there. He created an experiment using a metal plate, covering it with sand and then bowing it to create the Chladni patterns that you see here on the right. Moving on from this, the next person to explore this field was a gentleman called Hans Jenny in the 1970s. What we can see here is the metal sheet, this time connected to a sound driver and being fed by a frequency generator. As you can see with your own eyes. (Applause) So, what excites me about cymatics? Through the numerous ways that we can apply cymatics, we can actually start to unveil the substance of things not seen. Devices like the cymascope, which you can see here, have been used to scientifically observe cymatic patterns. This image here is created from a snippet of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony playing through a cymatic device. We can also use cymatics as a looking glass into nature. So, for example, here on the left we can see a snowflake as it would appear in nature. And if we kind of ponder on that, then perhaps cymatics had an influence on the formation of the universe itself. I want to urge everybody here to apply your passion, your knowledge and your skills to areas like cymatics.","Cymatics is the process of visualizing sound by vibrating a medium such as sand or water.

496,"What I'd like to do first is take you through a very brief helicopter ride of stunts and the stunts industry in the movies and in television, and show you how technology has started to interface with the physical skills of the stunt performer in a way that makes the stunts bigger and actually makes them safer than they've ever been before. This thing is called an air ram. And that's in the up position. We used to have to drive up a ramp, and we still do sometimes. It's 30 feet. He did a jump from 100,000 feet, 102,000 to be precise, and he did it to test high altitude systems for military pilots in the new range of aircraft that were going up to 80,000 feet or so. And I'd just like to show you a little footage of what he did back then. This is him in a pressure suit. Now one of the challenges of going up to altitude is when you get to 30,000 feet -- it's great, isn't it? -- When you get to 30,000 feet you can really only use oxygen. So I've had to do quite a lot of training. This is what the view is going to be like at 90,000 feet for me. Trying to find a space suit to do this has led me to an area of technology that I never really expected when I set about doing this. You know if you are in an aircraft at 30,000 feet and the cabin depressurizes, you can have oxygen. I would like to bring Costa on, if he's here, to show you the only one of its kind in the world.","Technology has started to interface with the physical skills of the stunt performer.

497,"So, having seen all of this in the course of a 30-year career, I was still a skeptic about climate change until about 10 years ago, because I thought the story of climate change was based on computer models. When I realized that climate change was real, and it was not based on computer models, I decided that one day I would do a project looking at trying to manifest climate change photographically. And one crazy day, I got the idea that I should -- after that assignment was finished -- I got the idea that I should shoot in time-lapse photography, that I should station a camera or two at a glacier and let it shoot every 15 minutes, or every hour or whatever and watch the progression of the landscape over time. And these cameras are positioned on rocks on the sides of the glaciers, and they look in on the glacier from permanent, bedrock positions, and they watch the evolution of the landscape. This is what one of our cameras saw over the course of a few months. If you look in the middle background, you can see the calving face bobbing up and down like a yo-yo. We're going to be up there in just a few more weeks, and we expect that it's probably retreated another half a mile, but if I got there and discovered that it had collapsed and it was five miles further back, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised. Now it's really hard to grasp the scale of these places, because as the glaciers -- one of the things is that places like Alaska and Greenland are huge, they're not normal landscapes -- but as the glaciers are retreating, they're also deflating, like air is being let out of a balloon. That's what you see with these cameras. So that's where we started three years ago, way out on the left, and that's where we were a few months ago, the last time we went into Columbia. And here, if you watch, you can see the terminus retreating. And on up to Greenland. And there's been a tremendous increase in the temperature up there. The one glacier up in Greenland that puts more ice into the global ocean than all the other glaciers in the northern hemisphere combined is the Ilulissat Glacier. It's hard to get it.","Time-lapse photography shows the progression of the landscape over time. The cameras are positioned on rocks on the sides of the glaciers.

498,"He could tell a story about an event, and so you felt you were absolutely there at the moment. What he was trying to do with me was to inspire me to protect the world, and show me just how fragile the world is. Some people think that swimming is a very solo sport, you just dive into the sea and off you go. I had to see it from the beginning all the way to the end. And it was -- the paradox is that you're in freezing cold water, but actually you're on fire. And I remember taking the goggles off my face and looking down at my hands in sheer shock, because my fingers had swollen so much that they were like sausages. And this dream which I had had ever since I was a young boy with my father, was just going out the window. And I remember then getting out of the shower and realizing I couldn't even feel my hands. And Ran decided to go into his tool shed and take out a saw and do it himself. And my close friend David, he saw the way I was thinking, and he came up to me and he said, ""Lewis, I've known you since you were 18 years old. I've known you, and I know, Lewis, deep down, right deep down here, that you are going to make this swim. Lewis, have the courage to go in there, because we are going to look after you every moment of it."" And I just, I got so much confidence from him saying that, because he knew me so well. But was it worth it? The second thing we need to do is we need to just look back at how far we have come in such a short period of time.","He could tell a story about an event, and so you felt you were absolutely there at the moment.

499,"And the problem I'm going to talk about is not the familiar one from philosophy, which is, ""How can we know whether other people have minds?"" So that's a problem in philosophy, but for today's purposes I'm going to assume that many people in this audience have a mind, and that I don't have to worry about this. Or to say, as Alan Greenspan did, ""I know you think you understand what you thought I said, but I'm not sure you realize that what you heard is not what I meant."" So first, the first thing I want to tell you is that there is a brain region in the human brain, in your brains, whose job it is to think about other people's thoughts. (Laughter) The second thing I want to say about this brain system is that although we human adults are really good at understanding other minds, we weren't always that way. Ivan comes back and he says, ""I want my cheese sandwich."" Child: I think he is going to take that one. RS: Yeah, you think he's going to take that one? RS: And Ivan says, ""I want my cheese sandwich."" Do you think he's going to take that one? (Laughter) And now what we've started to do in my lab is to put children into the brain scanner and ask what's going on in their brain as they develop this ability to think about other people's thoughts. So the first thing is that in children we see this same brain region, the Right TPJ, being used while children are thinking about other people. So that's good, but of course what we'd rather is have a way to interfere with function in this brain region, and see if we could change people's moral judgment. But in the case of a failed attempt to harm, where Grace thought that it was poison, although it was really sugar, people now say it was more okay, she deserves less blame for putting the powder in the coffee. The changes I showed you are impressive to me because of what they tell us about the function of the brain, but they're small on the scale of the moral judgments that we actually make.","The problem I'm going to talk about is not the familiar one from philosophy, which is, ""How can we know whether other people have minds?""
